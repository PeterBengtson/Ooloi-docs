# Ooloi Guides

This directory contains guides for understanding Ooloi's core concepts and APIs. **These guides also serve as practical tutorials for Clojure programming concepts**, using musical examples to teach functional programming patterns, concurrency, and data transformation techniques.

## Recommended Reading Order

**Start here if you're new to Ooloi:**

1. **🟢 [TIMEWALKING_GUIDE.md](TIMEWALKING_GUIDE.md)** - Musical traversal patterns (beginner-friendly)
2. **🟢 [PIECE_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md](PIECE_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md)** - Asynchronous I/O (foundational)
3. **🟡 [VPDs.md](VPDs.md)** - Path-based navigation (core concepts)
4. **🟡 [PIECE_MANAGER_GUIDE.md](PIECE_MANAGER_GUIDE.md)** - Basic storage operations (important)
5. **🟠 [POLYMORPHIC_API_GUIDE.md](POLYMORPHIC_API_GUIDE.md)** - Type system foundations (advanced intermediate)
6. **🟠 [GRPC_COMMUNICATION_AND_FLOW_CONTROL.md](GRPC_COMMUNICATION_AND_FLOW_CONTROL.md)** - gRPC communication patterns (distributed systems)
7. **🔴 [GRPC_STREAMING_THREADING_GUIDE.md](GRPC_STREAMING_THREADING_GUIDE.md)** - gRPC streaming implementation patterns (advanced threading - trips up developers across all languages)
8. **🔵 [OOLOI_SERVER_ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md](OOLOI_SERVER_ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md)** - Server architecture reference (comprehensive)
9. **🔴 [ADVANCED_CONCURRENCY_PATTERNS.md](ADVANCED_CONCURRENCY_PATTERNS.md)** - Performance optimization (advanced/dangerous)
