# Ooloi Guides

This directory contains guides for understanding Ooloi's core concepts and APIs. **These guides also serve as practical tutorials for Clojure programming concepts**, using musical examples to teach functional programming patterns, concurrency, and data transformation techniques.

## Recommended Reading Order

**Start here if you're new to Ooloi:**

1. **[POLYMORPHIC_API_GUIDE.md](POLYMORPHIC_API_GUIDE.md)** ‚≠ê - Type system foundations
2. **[VPDs.md](VPDs.md)** - Path-based navigation
3. **[PIECE_MANAGER_GUIDE.md](PIECE_MANAGER_GUIDE.md)** - Basic storage operations
4. **[TIMEWALKING_GUIDE.md](TIMEWALKING_GUIDE.md)** - Musical traversal patterns
5. **[GRPC_COMMUNICATION_AND_FLOW_CONTROL.md](GRPC_COMMUNICATION_AND_FLOW_CONTROL.md)** üî¥ - gRPC communication patterns
6. **[OOLOI_SERVER_ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md](OOLOI_SERVER_ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md)** üî¥ - Server architecture deep dive  
7. **[PIECE_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md](PIECE_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md)** - Asynchronous I/O
8. **[ADVANCED_CONCURRENCY_PATTERNS.md](ADVANCED_CONCURRENCY_PATTERNS.md)** üî¥ - Performance optimization
