## Overview

The Ooloi backend server represents a specialized approach to collaborative editing servers, combining the strengths of functional programming, distributed systems, and domain-specific design. Built specifically for collaborative music notation editing, it demonstrates how Clojure's Software Transactional Memory (STM) can integrate with unified protocol buffers and real-time event streaming to create a server architecture optimized for complex musical data manipulation and multi-user collaboration.

## Core Architecture

### Unified Protocol Buffer Design

Unlike typical gRPC services that generate dozens or hundreds of message types for different operations, Ooloi uses a **single unified message type**: `OoloiValue`. This approach eliminates the traditional gRPC complexity of:

- Complex schema generation pipelines
- Schema versioning conflicts during plugin installation
- Type fidelity loss across network boundaries
- Reflection-based introspection systems

```
Traditional gRPC:
├── UserMessage
├── NoteMessage  
├── ChordMessage
├── ArticulationMessage
├── StaffMessage
└── ... (85+ message types)

Ooloi gRPC:
└── OoloiValue (handles all data types)
```

### Perfect Type Fidelity

The server preserves complete Clojure semantic fidelity across the network boundary:

- **Mathematical ratios** remain ratios (not converted to decimals)
- **Namespaced keywords** preserve their namespaces
- **Nested data structures** maintain their exact shape
- **Plugin-defined record types** work automatically without schema changes

This is achieved through a specialized conversion layer that maps Clojure types to protobuf representations:

```clojure
;; Example: Complex musical data preserved exactly
{:type :chord
 :duration 3/4          ; Ratio preserved
 :pitches #{::pitch/C4  ; Namespaced keywords preserved
            ::pitch/E4
            ::pitch/G4}
 :dynamics [:p :cresc]} ; Nested structures preserved
```

### Software Transactional Memory Integration

The server integrates Clojure's STM directly with gRPC operations, enabling **distributed ACID transactions**:

- **Atomic batch operations**: Multiple musical modifications succeed or fail together
- **Conflict resolution**: STM handles concurrent edits automatically  
- **Consistency guarantees**: Musical scores never enter invalid intermediate states
- **Isolation**: Concurrent users don't see partial modifications

```clojure
;; Example: Atomic multi-staff transposition
(dosync
  (alter-piece piece-id transpose-staff :violin-1 :up-major-third)
  (alter-piece piece-id transpose-staff :violin-2 :up-major-third)
  (alter-piece piece-id update-key-signature :E-major))
```

### Dynamic API Method Resolution

Instead of generating static service interfaces, the server uses **runtime method discovery**:

- API methods are defined as regular Clojure functions
- `ns-resolve` discovers methods at runtime
- Plugin methods work immediately without server restarts
- Zero code generation complexity

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client Request] --> B[Dynamic Resolution]
    B --> C{Method Exists?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Execute Function]
    C -->|No| E[Return Error]
    D --> F[Return Result]
    
    subgraph "Method Discovery"
    B --> G[ns-resolve lookup]
    G --> H[Plugin namespaces]
    G --> I[Core namespaces]
    end
```

## Real-Time Event Streaming

### Two-Tier Event System

The server implements a sophisticated event notification system for collaborative editing:

**Server Events**: Global notifications (maintenance, shutdowns, connections)
- Broadcast to all connected clients
- Used for system-wide coordination

**Piece Events**: Musical content notifications with hierarchical targeting
- `piece-layout-invalidated`: Entire score reformatted
- `piece-page-invalidated`: Page layout changes  
- `piece-system-invalidated`: Staff grouping changes
- `piece-staff-invalidated`: Individual staff changes
- `piece-measures-invalidated`: Note content changes

### High-Performance Event Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Event Generation"
    A[Musical Change] --> B[Event Creation]
    B --> C[Event Classification]
    end
    
    subgraph "Event Routing"
    C --> D{Server Event?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Broadcast to All Clients]
    D -->|No| F[Check Piece Subscriptions]
    F --> G[Route to Subscribed Clients]
    end
    
    subgraph "Event Delivery"
    E --> H[Per-Client Queues]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Async Thread Pool]
    I --> J[Drop-Oldest Overflow]
    J --> K[Client Delivery]
    end
```

### Performance Optimizations

**Asynchronous Delivery**: Events are delivered via dedicated thread pools, ensuring slow clients never block fast clients or server operations.

**Queue-Based Flow Control**: Each client has an independent bounded queue (default 1000 events) with drop-oldest overflow handling.

**Burst Traffic Handling**: The system maintains stability under high-volume event bursts (tested with 2000+ rapid events).

**Subscription Filtering**: Events are only delivered to clients that have explicitly subscribed to specific pieces, reducing unnecessary network traffic.

## Connection Management

### Connection Registry Architecture

The server maintains a concurrent connection registry using atoms for O(1) client lookup:

```clojure
;; Registry structure
{client-id {:observer stream-observer
           :metadata {:connected-at timestamp}
           :piece-subscriptions #{piece-id-1 piece-id-2}
           :event-queue bounded-queue
           :consumer-thread thread-ref}}
```

### Lifecycle Management

- **Automatic server subscriptions**: Clients receive server events upon connection
- **Manual piece subscriptions**: API methods for piece-specific event subscriptions  
- **Graceful cleanup**: Disconnected clients are automatically removed from all registries
- **Resource management**: Event queues and consumer threads are properly cleaned up

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive gRPC Status Mapping

The server maps Clojure exceptions to appropriate gRPC status codes:

- `IllegalArgumentException` → `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
- `SecurityException` → `PERMISSION_DENIED`  
- `UnsupportedOperationException` → `UNIMPLEMENTED`
- `TimeoutException` → `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`
- Generic exceptions → `INTERNAL`

### Distributed Error Propagation

Errors in STM transactions or musical operations are properly propagated across the gRPC boundary with structured error information and context.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Musical Domain Specialization

Unlike general-purpose servers, Ooloi is designed specifically for musical data:

- **VPD (Visual-Physical-Dispositional) addressing**: Hierarchical addressing system for musical elements
- **Musical type preservation**: Ratios, intervals, and musical constructs maintain their semantic meaning
- **Collaborative editing patterns**: Built for real-time multi-user music editing workflows

### 2. Plugin-Friendly Architecture

- **Zero-downtime plugin deployment**: New musical notation systems can be added without server restarts
- **Automatic API discovery**: Plugin methods are immediately available via dynamic resolution
- **Type compatibility**: Any plugin data structures work automatically through the unified protocol

### 3. Distributed ACID Guarantees

- **STM-gRPC integration**: True ACID transactions across network boundaries
- **Conflict-free collaboration**: Multiple users can edit simultaneously with automatic conflict resolution
- **Consistency preservation**: Musical scores cannot enter semantically invalid states

### 4. Performance-First Design

- **Built for speed**: Event streaming and flow control designed for high-performance from day one
- **Scalable architecture**: Async processing and bounded queues prevent resource exhaustion  
- **Burst handling**: System remains stable under intense load conditions
- **Resource efficiency**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks in long-running collaborative sessions

### 5. Type System Integration

- **Clojure-native**: Leverages Clojure's strengths (STM, immutability, dynamic typing) rather than fighting them
- **Protocol buffer adaptation**: Uses protobuf as a transport layer while preserving high-level semantics
- **Cross-language compatibility**: Can interoperate with other JVM languages while maintaining type fidelity

## Comparison with Enterprise Solutions

### Traditional Enterprise gRPC Architecture

Most enterprise gRPC services follow conventional patterns that create significant operational complexity:

**Schema Management Burden**
