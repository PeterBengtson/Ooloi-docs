# ADR-0028: Hierarchical Rendering Pipeline with Plugin-Based Formatters

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-09-14

## Context

Musical notation software faces computational challenges when handling large orchestral scores containing hundreds of thousands of individual musical elements. The fundamental problem involves coordinating distinct concerns: musical logic resolution, spatial arrangement calculations, and visual rendering - each with different computational characteristics and parallelisation opportunities.

**Real-World Scalability Challenge**: Traditional notation software famously struggles with large complex scores such as Strauss's Elektra recognition scene - dense orchestral passages with intricate notation that cause performance degradation, memory exhaustion, and unresponsive editing. These scenarios expose the limitations of eager computation approaches that attempt to process entire scores regardless of user viewport or editing context.

The challenge lies in providing a unified architecture that handles both fundamental notation formatting (chord layouts, articulation placement, beam positioning) and contemporary notational extensions without architectural distinction or performance compromise.

Ooloi requires an architecture that maintains responsive editing performance with the most demanding symphonic works whilst implementing all notation formatting through a unified plugin system where canonical plugins handle standard notation alongside custom extensions.

### Architectural Foundation: Frontend-Backend Separation

Ooloi's [frontend-backend separation](0001-Frontend-Backend-Separation.md) provides multiple architectural advantages that directly inform the rendering pipeline design:

**Separation of Concerns**: Frontend remains pure UI/rendering while backend handles musical logic and computation, preventing architectural conflation and maintaining clean cognitive boundaries.

**Collaboration as Consequence**: Standalone applications operate as "collaboration groups of 1" - the same architectural patterns scale naturally to multi-user scenarios without special collaborative features.

**Performance Without Compromise**: In-process gRPC transport eliminates 99% of network overhead (36Î¼s roundtrip measured on 2017 MacBook Pro), proving separation costs nothing performance-wise whilst enabling optimal lazy evaluation patterns.

**Type Fidelity Preservation**: Clojure defrecord instances (`Tuplet`, `Pitch`, etc.) maintain identical structure across gRPC boundaries, eliminating serialization impedance mismatch and enabling plugins to operate identically in local or distributed modes.

## Decision

Ooloi implements a **four-stage hierarchical rendering pipeline** with comprehensive plugin integration and intelligent client-server coordination:

### Pipeline Stage 1: Musical Logic Resolution and Spatial Analysis
Individual measures process their internal musical content independently:
- Note transpositions and pitch calculations
- Effective accidental determination based on key signatures and measure context
- Tie, slur, and beam resolution
- Key signature and time signature propagation
- **Engraving Atom Formation**: Each rhythmic position calculates its complete spatial unit - noteheads, stems, accidentals, articulations positioned relative to each other as an indivisible "engraving atom"
- **Plugin Hook Integration**: Spacing hooks fire for each notational element, contributing spatial requirements to atom formation
- **Atom Dimension Caching**: Once calculated for a rhythmic configuration, engraving atoms remain **immutable** until measure content changes, enabling efficient repositioning without recomputation

### Pipeline Stage 2: Rhythmic Proportional Distribution
Measures coordinate optimal spacing using pre-computed engraving atoms:
- **Atom Repositioning**: Pre-computed engraving atoms moved horizontally for optimal rhythmic alignment - no internal atom recalculation required
- **Rhythmic proportion calculation**: Distributes space according to rhythmic relationships - longer note values receive proportionally more horizontal space
- **Cross-staff synchronisation**: Ensures consistent rhythmic spacing across all staves within each measure number
- **Computational Efficiency**: Much faster than Stage 1 since atom dimensions are cached - only atom positioning changes

### Pipeline Stage 3: Hierarchical Layout Organization
Measure streams are organized into visual layouts with full hierarchical cascade awareness:
- **Stage 3a - System Breaking**: Groups measures into horizontal systems based on available width and discomfort optimization
- **Stage 3b - Page Breaking** (conditional): Arranges systems vertically within page boundaries when system changes affect pagination
- **Stage 3c - Layout Restructuring** (conditional): Full layout reorganization when page changes require adding/removing pages or cross-movement adjustments
- **Cross-hierarchy element coordination**: Manages ties, slurs, and other elements spanning system and page breaks
- **Hierarchical cascade detection**: Automatically determines when system changes require page recalculation, and when page changes require full layout restructuring

### Pipeline Stage 4: Visual Element Generation
With final positioning established, measures generate their visual output:
- **Coordinate finalisation**: Combines positioning data with spatial measurements from earlier stages
- **Visual element assembly**: Creates rendering instructions for glyphs, curves, and text elements
- **Layout-specific adjustments**: Applies zoom levels, display preferences, and viewport optimisations

### Plugin Architecture Integration

Every notational element participates through a unified plugin interface with **mandatory two-stage compliance**:

    style E fill:#c5e1a5,color:#000
    style F fill:#d1c4e9,color:#000
```

#### Spacing Hook
Plugins declare the spatial requirements of their elements:
- **Input**: Musical element data and contextual information
- **Output**: Width requirements, indicative height, and collision boundaries

#### Paint Hook  
Plugins generate visual rendering instructions:
- **Input**: Musical element data with finalised positioning coordinates
- **Output**: Rendering instructions (glyphs, curves, text) with precise coordinates

**Registry-Based Discovery**: The plugin registry maintains mappings between musical elements and their formatters, enabling runtime composition and replacement of notational elements.

        B->>C1: Same updated paintlist (shared computation)

    end

    alt Client 2 not viewing measure 127
        Note over C2: Cache stays dirty until user navigates there
    end
```

This sequence illustrates the complete system flow when a user adds a note, demonstrating the pipeline's lazy evaluation characteristics, asynchronous batching, collaborative event distribution, and viewport-aware client responses.

## Computational Scaling Characteristics

Independent measure analysis can run in parallel during Stage 1. System chunks can also be parallelised during Stage 3 processing. Pipeline stages naturally separate concerns, enabling different parallelisation strategies for each computational phase.

**Engraving Atom Efficiency**: The two-phase spatial computation (atom formation + positioning) provides intelligent caching granularity:
- Adding notes to existing rhythmic positions â atom recalculation + positioning
- Changing note spacing â positioning only (atoms unchanged)
- Adding accidentals â atom recalculation + positioning
- Changing time signatures â positioning only (atoms unchanged)

Memory access patterns prove favourable as each processing unit operates on distinct memory regions during parallel operations, minimising cache conflicts and false sharing between processors.

The 100-millisecond **asynchronous** batching interval amplifies computational efficiency by amortising processing costs across multiple edits, accumulating changes and processing them in optimally-sized batches. Crucially, mutating API calls return immediately without waiting for batch processing.

## Claypoole Integration Architecture

After comprehensive evaluation of parallel processing options, **Claypoole** has been selected as the optimal solution for Ooloi's CPU-intensive layout calculations, providing 16x performance improvement over pmap with superior resource control.

### Dependencies

```clojure
;; Add to backend/project.clj
[org.clj-commons/claypoole "1.2.2"]
```

### Parallel Processing Approach Selection

**Claypoole Selection Rationale:**

After comprehensive evaluation of parallel processing options, Claypoole provides the optimal combination of performance, control, and integration characteristics for musical notation rendering:

**Performance Advantages:**
- **16x performance improvement** over built-in `pmap` for CPU-intensive layout calculations
- **Near-linear scaling** up to available CPU cores (3.5-3.8x speedup on 4-core systems)
- **Superior CPU utilization** through configurable thread pools vs pmap's fixed threading

**Compared to Alternatives:**
- **`pmap`**: Unpredictable performance due to lazy evaluation and fixed `(ncpus + 2)` threading - avoided for production
- **`reducers/fold`**: Better for pure mathematical operations but limited by associative function requirements - doesn't fit measure-level processing
- **`core.async` pipelines**: Higher overhead with fixed 8-thread default, suboptimal for CPU-bound work
- **Custom `ForkJoinPool`**: Maximum performance potential but requires complex implementation and lacks Clojure integration

**`cp/pmap` Selection within Claypoole:**

Within Claypoole's API, `cp/pmap` provides the best fit for musical notation processing:

**Ordered Processing Requirement:**
- Musical measures must maintain sequence relationships for cross-measure elements (ties, slurs, spacing)
- `cp/pmap` preserves input order, unlike `cp/upmap` which returns results unordered
- Stage-to-stage data flow requires predictable result positioning

**API Simplicity:**
- `cp/pmap` provides direct replacement for `pmap` with controllable threadpool
- Simpler than manual `cp/future` coordination for batch processing
- More natural than `cp/pfor` for functional processing patterns

**Resource Control:**
- Explicit threadpool specification enables priority scheduling based on musical structure dependencies
- Controlled memory overhead through threadpool sizing
- Clean integration with Integrant component lifecycle

### Core Architecture Principles

The Claypoole integration follows a strict separation of concerns that prevents architectural conflation:

* **Claypoole handles execution substrate**: threadpool management, bounded parallelism, resource lifecycle, and backpressure control
* **Domain scheduler handles musical coordination**: operation tracking, STM transactions, and cooperative cancellation
* **Clean separation prevents complexity explosion**: execution primitives never mix with musical business logic

This separation is critical because musical notation rendering has sophisticated coordination requirements (operation-based cancellation, STM transaction management, hierarchical invalidation) that generic parallel processing libraries cannot and should not address. Claypoole provides the execution foundation while Ooloi's domain logic maintains complete control over coordination semantics.

### Resource Lifecycle Management

Musical notation software requires deterministic resource management because layout calculations run continuously in response to user edits. Unlike batch processing scenarios, notation editors must manage threadpools as long-lived resources with predictable cleanup behavior.

### Threadpool Component Integration

```clojure
(defmethod ig/init-key ::renderer [_ {:keys [cpu-cores]}]
  (let [cores (or cpu-cores (.availableProcessors (Runtime/getRuntime)))]
    {:cpu-pool (cp/threadpool cores)
     :priority-pool (cp/priority-threadpool cores)  ; For visible measures
     :metrics (atom {})}))

(defmethod ig/halt-key! ::renderer [_ renderer]
  (when-let [cpu (:cpu-pool renderer)]
    (cp/shutdown cpu))
  (when-let [prio (:priority-pool renderer)]
    (cp/shutdown prio)))
```

**Integrant Integration**: The component system manages threadpool lifecycle deterministically. Manual resource management is essential because threadpools maintain daemon threads that prevent JVM shutdown if not explicitly cleaned up.

**Dual Pool Strategy**: Standard and priority threadpools enable responsive editing behavior. Priority pools process high-priority measures first, ensuring critical musical structure updates receive immediate attention during complex score processing.

**Thread Count Configuration**: Pool sizing defaults to physical CPU cores, optimizing for CPU-bound layout calculations. This prevents thread oversubscription and context switching overhead.

### Cross-Thread Context Management

Claypoole executes tasks on threadpool threads that don't inherit dynamic variable bindings from the calling thread. Musical notation rendering requires consistent context (operation tracking, musical settings) across all parallel tasks.

**Binding Conveyance with `cp/pmap`**: Claypoole automatically handles binding conveyance for dynamic variables, ensuring that `*current-operation*` is available to all parallel tasks without explicit capture.

**Exception Context Preservation**: Task failures need to maintain debugging information across thread boundaries. This is critical for diagnosing layout calculation failures in complex musical scenarios:

```clojure
(cp/pmap cpu-pool
  (fn [measure-id]
    (try
      (with-cancellation
        (analyze-measure piece measure-id))
      (catch Exception e
        (throw (ex-info "Layout calculation failed"
                        {:measure-id measure-id
                         :operation-id *current-operation*}
                        e)))))
  measure-ids)
```

### STM Integration with Cooperative Cancellation

The rendering pipeline coordinates Claypoole parallel processing within STM transactions. Since only one formatting operation runs at a time, cancellation uses simple global state coordination.

### Single-Operation Architecture

**Key Constraint**: Only one formatting operation runs at any given time, eliminating complex concurrency coordination requirements.

**Cancellation Strategy**: Global operation tracking with dynamic variable binding enables responsive cancellation of parallel tasks within STM transactions.

```clojure
;; Global formatting coordination
(defonce ^:private current-formatting-operation (atom nil))

(def ^:dynamic *current-operation* nil)

(defn cancelled? []
  "Check if current parallel task should abort"
  (not= *current-operation* @current-formatting-operation))

(defmacro with-cancellation [& body]
  "Execute body with cancellation checking"
  `(if (cancelled?) ::cancelled (do ~@body)))
```

### Integrated STM and Claypoole Implementation

```clojure
(defn run-formatting-pipeline! [renderer piece-ref measure-ids]
  "Complete formatting pipeline with Claypoole and STM integration"
  (let [operation-id (java.util.UUID/randomUUID)
        {:keys [cpu-pool]} renderer]

    ;; Set current operation (outside STM)
    (reset! current-formatting-operation operation-id)

    ;; Execute pipeline within STM transaction
    (dosync
      (alter piece-ref
        (fn [piece]
          (binding [*current-operation* operation-id]
            ;; Stage 1: Parallel spatial analysis
            (let [stage1-results (cp/pmap cpu-pool
                                          (fn [measure-id]
                                            (with-cancellation
                                              (analyze-measure piece measure-id)))
                                          measure-ids)]

              (if (some #{::cancelled} stage1-results)
                piece  ; Return unchanged if cancelled
                ;; Continue with remaining stages
                (-> piece
                    (apply-rhythmic-distribution stage1-results)
                    (apply-system-breaking)
                    (generate-visual-elements)
                    (generate-invalidation-events))))))))))
```

### Cancellation Flow

**Responsive Editing**: When user makes new edits during active formatting:

1. **New operation starts**: `(reset! current-formatting-operation new-id)`
2. **Old tasks detect cancellation**: `(cancelled?)` returns `true`
3. **Tasks abort cleanly**: Return `::cancelled` without corrupting state
4. **STM handles consistency**: Transaction proceeds with partial results or unchanged piece

**Benefits**:
- **Simple cancellation**: Global operation tracking enables clean task abortion
- **STM compatibility**: No side effects within transactions
- **Responsive editing**: Long-running calculations abort quickly when new edits arrive
- **Clean state**: Cancelled operations leave no partial modifications

### Four-Stage Pipeline Implementation

Each pipeline stage uses Claypoole for parallel processing within the STM transaction:

**Pipeline Characteristics:**
- **Single STM transaction**: All stages execute within one `dosync` block with no side effects
- **Iterative Stage 3 â Stage 2 convergence**: When system optimization moves measures, rhythmic distribution recalculates for affected systems until width requirements stabilize
- **Hierarchical cascade handling**: System changes trigger page recalculation; page changes trigger full layout restructuring
- **Conditional stage execution**: Page breaking and layout restructuring execute only when system/page changes require them
- **Multi-modal convergence detection**: Local minimum detection, plateau detection, tolerance threshold, and maximum iterations ensure optimal stopping conditions
- **Parallel alternative evaluation**: Width configurations and layout alternatives evaluated concurrently to find deterministic optimal solutions
- **Post-transaction events**: Invalidation events sent after STM transaction completes successfully
- **Cancellation at each stage**: Any stage can abort cleanly if new edits arrive, including during iterative convergence
- **Claypoole parallelism**: Each stage uses `cp/pmap` for parallel processing where applicable
- **Progressive computation**: Each stage builds on results from previous stages with iterative refinement awareness
- **Atomic updates**: Either entire hierarchical pipeline succeeds or piece remains unchanged

### Discomfort-Driven Iterative Optimization

Musical notation layout quality is maintained through an iterative discomfort minimization algorithm that automatically reorganizes measures, systems, and pages to achieve optimal spacing while respecting musical and user-imposed constraints.

### Core Discomfort Algorithm

The layout engine continuously measures and minimizes "discomfort" - the deviation of each layout element from its ideal proportions:

```clojure
(defn calculate-total-discomfort [piece]
  "Calculate system-wide layout discomfort"
  (+ (measure-stack-discomfort piece)
     (system-spacing-discomfort piece)
     (page-density-discomfort piece)))

(defn measure-stack-discomfort [piece]
  "Sum of width deviations from ideal for all measure stacks"
  (->> (get-all-measure-stacks piece)
       (map (fn [stack]
              (Math/abs (- (actual-width stack)
                          (ideal-width stack)))))
       (reduce +)))

(defn run-discomfort-optimization! [renderer piece-ref operation-id optimization-plugins]
  "Iterative discomfort minimization with plugin-driven strategies"
  (let [{:keys [cpu-pool]} renderer
        acceptable-discomfort (get-discomfort-threshold piece-ref)
        max-iterations (get-max-optimization-iterations piece-ref)]

    (loop [iteration 0
           current-discomfort (calculate-total-discomfort @piece-ref)

        ;; Success: Acceptable quality achieved

        {:result :converged :iterations iteration :final-discomfort current-discomfort}

        ;; Hard stop: Maximum iterations reached
        (>= iteration max-iterations)

                              (apply-layout-changes (:layout-changes best-strategy))
                              (track-expanded-affected-region (:expanded-region best-strategy))))))))

              new-discomfort (calculate-total-discomfort @piece-ref)

          (if (reached-hard-constraint-boundary? @piece-ref expanded-region)
            {:result :constraint-boundary :iterations iteration :final-discomfort new-discomfort}
            ;; Continue optimization with expanded region
            (recur (inc iteration) new-discomfort expanded-region)))))))

```

**Convergence Characteristics:**
- **Guaranteed Termination**: Process always stops through acceptable discomfort, constraint boundaries, or iteration limits
- **Progressive Improvement**: Each iteration reduces total layout discomfort through best-strategy selection
- **Automatic Scope Expansion**: Affected region grows organically until optimization boundaries are reached
- **Constraint Respect**: Hard boundaries (manual breaks, movement divisions) prevent inappropriate cross-boundary optimization
- **Plugin Extensibility**: Custom optimization strategies can be added for domain-specific layout intelligence

### Plugin-Driven Optimization Strategies

Optimization strategies are implemented as plugins, enabling domain-specific layout intelligence and user customization:

```clojure
(defprotocol OptimizationStrategy
  "Plugin interface for layout optimization strategies"
  (analyze-discomfort [strategy piece affected-region]
    "Analyze current discomfort and propose optimization approach")
  (apply-optimization [strategy piece region-analysis]
    "Apply optimization changes and return updated piece with expanded affected region"))

;; Built-in optimization strategies
(def default-optimization-strategies
  [(->MeasureReflowStrategy)      ; Redistribute measures across systems
   (->SystemRebreakStrategy)      ; Rebreak systems across pages
   (->VerticalSpacingStrategy)    ; Adjust staff spacing within systems
   (->PageMarginStrategy)])       ; Adjust page margins and scaling

(defn apply-optimization-strategy [strategy piece affected-region]
  "Execute a single optimization strategy"
  (let [analysis (analyze-discomfort strategy piece affected-region)
        result (apply-optimization strategy piece analysis)]
    {:layout-changes (:changes result)
     :expanded-region (:new-affected-region result)
     :resulting-discomfort (calculate-total-discomfort (:updated-piece result))}))

;; Enhanced optimization with parallel alternative evaluation
(defn evaluate-measure-width-alternatives [piece system affected-measures]
  "Evaluate different measure width configurations in parallel to find optimal solution"
  (let [width-alternatives (generate-width-alternatives system affected-measures)]
    (cp/pmap (get-cpu-pool)
             (fn [width-config]
               (let [adjusted-system (apply-measure-widths system width-config)
                     resulting-discomfort (calculate-system-discomfort piece adjusted-system)]
                 {:width-config width-config
                  :resulting-discomfort resulting-discomfort
                  :system adjusted-system}))
             width-alternatives)))

(defn find-deterministic-optimal-layout [piece affected-region optimization-strategies]
  "Find optimal layout through exhaustive evaluation of reasonable alternatives"
  (let [layout-alternatives (generate-reasonable-layout-alternatives piece affected-region)]

    ;; Evaluate all alternatives in parallel
    (->> layout-alternatives
         (cp/pmap (get-cpu-pool)
                  (fn [layout-alternative]
                    (let [trial-piece (apply-layout-changes piece layout-alternative)]
                      {:layout layout-alternative
                       :discomfort (calculate-total-discomfort trial-piece)
                       :piece trial-piece})))
         ;; Select minimum discomfort solution
         (apply min-key :discomfort))))
```

### Outward Rippling and Constraint Boundaries

Optimization automatically expands its scope until discomfort is minimized or hard constraints prevent further expansion:

**Ripple Expansion Pattern:**
1. **Local Adjustment**: Initially optimize only directly affected measures
2. **System Expansion**: If local changes create system-level discomfort, expand to full system optimization
3. **Page Expansion**: If system changes create page-level discomfort, expand to page-level rebreaking
4. **Cross-Page Expansion**: If necessary, optimize across multiple pages until discomfort is acceptable

**Hard Constraint Boundaries (Optimization Stops):**
- **Manual Page Breaks**: User-inserted page breaks cannot be crossed during optimization
- **Manual System Breaks**: User-inserted system breaks constrain measure redistribution
- **Movement Boundaries**: Optimization cannot move measures across movement or section boundaries
- **Performance Directives**: Tempo changes, rehearsal marks, and other performance indicators create layout boundaries

```clojure
(defn reached-hard-constraint-boundary? [piece affected-region]
  "Check if optimization has reached uncrossable layout boundaries"
  (or (contains-manual-page-breaks? piece affected-region)
      (spans-movement-boundaries? piece affected-region)
      (conflicts-with-performance-directives? piece affected-region)
      (exceeds-maximum-optimization-scope? piece affected-region)))

(defn get-constraint-boundaries [piece starting-region]
  "Identify hard boundaries that limit optimization scope expansion"
  {:manual-breaks (find-manual-breaks-near piece starting-region)
   :movement-boundaries (find-movement-boundaries piece starting-region)
   :performance-directives (find-performance-directives piece starting-region)
   :scope-limits (calculate-maximum-reasonable-scope piece starting-region)})
```

### Integration with Pipeline Processing

Discomfort optimization integrates with the four-stage pipeline, running after initial layout calculation to refine results:

**Stage 3 Enhancement**: System Breaking stage now includes iterative optimization:

```clojure
(defn enhanced-system-breaking-with-optimization! [renderer piece-ref system-data operation-id]
  "System breaking with integrated discomfort optimization"
  (binding [*current-operation* operation-id]
    ;; Initial system breaking (existing logic)
    (let [initial-systems (calculate-initial-system-breaks piece-ref system-data)
          initial-discomfort (calculate-total-discomfort @piece-ref)]

      ;; Apply discomfort optimization if threshold exceeded
      (if (> initial-discomfort (get-discomfort-threshold @piece-ref))
        (let [optimization-result
              (run-discomfort-optimization! renderer piece-ref operation-id
                                          (get-active-optimization-plugins @piece-ref))]
          ;; Return enhanced system breaking with optimization results
          (merge initial-systems optimization-result))
        ;; Return initial systems if discomfort acceptable
        {:systems initial-systems :optimization-result :not-needed}))))
```

**Optimization Plugin Registry:**

```clojure
(defn register-optimization-plugin! [plugin-registry strategy-impl]
  "Register custom optimization strategy"
  (swap! plugin-registry conj strategy-impl))

;; Enable user and domain-specific optimization strategies
(register-optimization-plugin! optimization-plugins (->CustomChoralSpacingStrategy))
(register-optimization-plugin! optimization-plugins (->UserPreferenceStrategy user-prefs))
```

**Algorithmic Characteristics:**
- **Convergent**: Always terminates through discomfort thresholds, iteration limits, or constraint boundaries
- **Plugin-Extensible**: Optimization strategies can be replaced or supplemented with domain-specific logic
- **Constraint-Aware**: Respects user layout intentions while optimizing within allowable boundaries
- **Parallel**: Multiple optimization strategies execute concurrently with best-result selection
- **Cancellable**: Integrates with cooperative cancellation for responsive editing during long optimizations

### Architectural Benefits Summary

The Claypoole integration with discomfort-driven optimization provides several critical advantages:

**Responsive Musical Processing**: Iterative optimization ensures that layout changes automatically achieve optimal musical spacing within user-defined constraints, maintaining professional engraving quality during complex score manipulation.

**Resource Predictability**: Explicit threadpool management provides deterministic resource usage patterns, essential for professional audio workstation integration where resource conflicts must be avoided.

**Simple Cancellation**: Global operation tracking with dynamic binding provides clean cancellation semantics without complex coordination machinery.

**STM Integration**: Parallel processing within STM transactions leverages automatic conflict resolution while maintaining transactional consistency across the entire pipeline.

**Computational Scalability**: Near-linear scaling with CPU cores provides predictable performance improvements on professional workstations with high core counts, enabling complex orchestral score processing.

**Architectural Simplicity**: Single-operation constraint eliminates complex concurrency coordination, enabling straightforward implementation and maintenance.

### Performance Characteristics

- **16x performance improvement** over pmap for CPU-intensive layout calculations
- **Near-linear scaling** up to available CPU cores (3.5-3.8x speedup on 4-core systems)
- **Controlled memory overhead**: Buffer size scales as `2 Ã pool_size` (eager) or `1 Ã pool_size` (lazy)
- **STM automatic conflict handling**: Transactions retry with fresh data when conflicts occur
- **Cooperative cancellation** with responsive abort behavior through operation tracking

## Caching and Incremental Processing

Pipeline results are cached until local edits change them. Invalidation works hierarchically: musical events trigger measure recalculation, which may trigger system recalculation, which may trigger page recalculation.

**Stage 1 Caching**: Spatial analysis results persist until any element affecting measure content changes. Measures that remain completely unchanged never require recalculation.

**Conditional Processing**: Later pipeline stages process only measures that underwent earlier stage recalculation. Unchanged measures retain their cached results unless positioning changes affect their coordinates.

**Cache Granularity**: Invalidation operates at measure-level precision, ensuring that unrelated changes don't trigger unnecessary recalculations across the composition.

### Client-Server Event Coordination

#### Batched Reformatting (100ms Intervals)
The backend accumulates formatting requests and processes them in 100-millisecond intervals, providing perceived real-time response whilst avoiding computational waste on rapid input sequences.

#### Hierarchical Invalidation Events
Clients receive optimised invalidation notifications that respect the visual hierarchy. Deduplication logic eliminates redundant updates - if an entire page requires recalculation, individual measure invalidations within that page are automatically eliminated.

#### Lazy Visual Realisation
Clients implement demand-driven rendering data fetching. Open layouts immediately request updated rendering instructions, whilst closed layouts mark invalidated elements for cleanup and fetch data only when subsequently opened.

**Collaborative Data Sharing**: Multiple clients requesting identical updated data receive shared computation results without triggering redundant backend processing, as all clients typically fetch identical MeasureView paintlists.

## Rationale

### Positive Aspects

1. **Performance Scalability**: The four-stage pipeline enables parallelisation across different computational characteristics, with each stage optimised for its specific processing requirements.

2. **Plugin-Based Fundamental Architecture**: All notation formatting - from basic chord layouts and articulation placement to custom extensions - operates through the same unified plugin system, eliminating distinction between "core" and "extended" functionality.

3. **Intelligent Resource Management**: Client-server coordination minimises computational waste whilst maintaining responsive user experience through demand-driven visual realisation.

4. **Musical Accuracy**: Pipeline separation ensures that musical logic resolution occurs independently of spatial concerns, preventing layout constraints from corrupting musical meaning.

5. **Incremental Processing**: Comprehensive caching with hierarchical invalidation provides dramatic performance improvements for typical editing scenarios.

6. **Transparent Distribution**: Type fidelity across gRPC boundaries eliminates serialization impedance, enabling plugins and musical logic to operate identically in local or distributed modes.

7. **Efficient Spatial Computation**: Engraving atom caching prevents unnecessary recomputation - most changes only require fast atom repositioning rather than expensive dimension recalculation.

### Negative Aspects

1. **Implementation Complexity**: The four-stage pipeline requires sophisticated coordination mechanisms and careful state management across stage boundaries.

2. **Plugin Development Requirements**: All formatting logic must implement both spacing and paint hooks, creating consistent architectural requirements across canonical and custom plugins.

3. **Memory Usage During Transitions**: Intermediate state between stages requires temporary storage, particularly significant for large scores.

4. **Debugging Complexity**: Issues may arise from interactions between stages, requiring debugging tools that can trace problems across the entire pipeline.

5. **Network Dependency for Collaboration**: Real-time collaborative features require reliable network connectivity; offline scenarios may experience degraded functionality.

### Mitigations

1. **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Automated testing covers cross-stage interactions and performance characteristics under realistic load conditions.

2. **Plugin Development Tools**: Scaffolding tools and examples reduce the complexity of implementing compliant plugins.

3. **Memory Monitoring**: Profiling tools track memory usage across stage transitions, enabling optimisation of large score handling.

4. **Debugging Infrastructure**: Specialised debugging tools provide visibility into stage transitions and plugin interactions.

5. **Offline Resilience**: Local formatting capabilities maintain basic functionality during network interruptions.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Hardcoded Core Notation Elements
**Approach**: Implement fundamental notation formatting (chord layouts, articulation placement, beam positioning) directly in core system with plugin architecture only for extensions.
**Rejection Reasons**:
- Creates artificial architectural distinction between fundamental and extended formatting logic
- Prevents unified optimization and caching strategies across all notation elements
- Violates architectural uniformity principle where all formatting logic follows identical patterns
- Complicates maintenance by requiring separate code paths for equivalent functionality
- Limits ability to customize or replace fundamental formatting behaviors when needed

## Notes

This architectural decision establishes Ooloi's rendering pipeline as a scalable system capable of handling professional-scale musical compositions through unified plugin-based formatting for all notation elements.

The mandatory plugin compliance ensures that fundamental notation formatting (chords, articulations, beams) and custom extensions operate through identical architectural patterns, providing a foundation for comprehensive musical expression without artificial distinctions between "core" and "extended" functionality.

The four-stage approach recognises that musical logic, spatial arrangement, layout organisation, and visual rendering represent distinct computational problems that benefit from separation and targeted optimisation, with all formatting logic implemented through canonical and custom plugins as first-class citizens.
