# ADR: Selection of JavaFX and Skija for the Frontend GUI

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Ooloi requires a high-performance, cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) for music notation editing and display. The GUI needs to handle complex musical scores with potentially hundreds of staves and thousands of measures, while providing a responsive and intuitive user experience. Additionally, the chosen technology should integrate well with our Clojure-based backend, support efficient rendering of musical notation, and provide high-quality, consistent printing across all platforms. The ability to produce professional-grade printed output is a critical requirement for a music notation application.

## Decision

We will use JavaFX as the primary GUI framework for Ooloi, with Skija (Java bindings for Skia) for high-performance 2D graphics rendering and printing.

## Rationale

1. Native Performance:
   - JavaFX provides native-like performance across different platforms.
   - Skija, being a Java binding for Skia (used in Chrome and Android), offers high-performance 2D graphics capabilities.

2. Clojure Compatibility:
   - JavaFX can be easily used with Clojure, maintaining language consistency across the project.
   - Existing Clojure wrappers for JavaFX (e.g., cljfx) can simplify development.

3. Cross-platform Support:
   - JavaFX applications can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal platform-specific code.

4. High-Quality, Consistent Printing:
   - Skija's rendering capabilities extend to printing, ensuring high-quality output.
   - Using the same rendering engine for display and printing guarantees consistency between screen and paper.
   - Cross-platform printing consistency is achievable as Skija handles the rendering independent of the operating system's print drivers.

5. Rich UI Components:
   - JavaFX provides a comprehensive set of UI controls and layouts out of the box.

6. Custom Rendering Capabilities:
   - Skija allows for custom, high-performance rendering of musical notation, crucial for both display and printing in Ooloi.

7. Scalability:
   - The combination of JavaFX and Skija can handle large, complex scores efficiently, both for on-screen display and printing.

8. Modern Architecture:
   - JavaFX's scene graph and property binding system align well with reactive programming models.

9. Community and Ecosystem:
   - Both JavaFX and Skija have active communities and ongoing development.

10. Familiarity:
    - The team has existing experience with Java-based technologies, reducing the learning curve.

11. Integration with Backend:
    - Using JVM-based technologies for both frontend and backend simplifies integration and data exchange.

## Consequences

### Positive

- High-performance rendering of complex musical scores on screen and in print.
- Consistent, high-quality printed output across all supported platforms.
- Consistent development experience with Clojure across frontend and backend.
- Cross-platform compatibility without significant additional effort.
- Flexibility to create custom UI components for specific music notation needs.
- Good integration with our backend architecture.
- Early implementation of printing functionality ensures it's a core, well-integrated feature.

### Negative

- Potential for larger application size due to bundling of JavaFX runtime.
- May require additional effort to achieve platform-specific look and feel if desired.
- Limited web deployment options compared to web-based technologies.
- Potential complexity in handling various paper sizes and printer-specific settings across platforms.

## Implementation Approach

1. Set up a basic JavaFX application structure using cljfx (Clojure JavaFX wrapper).
2. Integrate Skija for custom rendering of musical notation.
3. Implement core UI components using cljfx declarative syntax and JavaFX controls.
4. Develop custom JavaFX components for music-specific elements (e.g., staff, measure, note).
5. Use Skija for rendering detailed musical symbols and notation.
6. Implement reactive UI updates using cljfx's React-inspired declarative model.
7. Develop the printing subsystem early in the project:
   - Implement Skija-based rendering for print output.
   - Ensure consistency between screen display and printed output.
   - Develop a cross-platform print dialog and settings interface.
   - Implement support for various paper sizes and orientations.
8. Optimize rendering performance for large scores using techniques like virtualization.
9. Develop a theming system to allow for customizable appearances.
10. Implement platform-specific optimizations where necessary.
11. Conduct thorough testing of printing functionality across all supported platforms.

## Alternatives Considered

1. Electron (Web Technologies):
   - Rejected due to potential performance limitations with large scores and higher resource usage.
   - Concerns about achieving consistent, high-quality printing across platforms.

2. Qt (C++ with Clojure bindings):
   - Rejected due to more complex integration with Clojure and potential licensing concerns.
   - While Qt offers good printing support, integrating it with Clojure would be more challenging.

3. Java Swing:
   - Rejected in favor of the more modern JavaFX framework.
   - Printing in Swing can be more cumbersome and may not provide the same level of consistency across platforms.

4. Pure Web Technologies (ClojureScript):
   - Rejected due to performance concerns for complex score rendering and limitations in controlling print output precisely.
   - May be considered for future web-based versions, but not suitable for the core application where print quality is crucial.
