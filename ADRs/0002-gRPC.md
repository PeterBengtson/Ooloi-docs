# ADR-0002: Adoption of gRPC for Communication Between Frontend and Backend

## Status

Accepted (Updated July 2025)

## Context

Ooloi's architecture supports **three deployment models**: backend-only, frontend-only, and combined applications. The **backend hosts a gRPC server** while the **frontend acts as a gRPC client**. In combined deployments, both client and server run in the same process, while in separate deployments they communicate over the network. We need to choose a protocol that can handle complex data structures, provide type safety, and offer high performance for real-time interactions with large musical scores.

**Updated Context (July 2025)**: Production experience and community feedback show significant limitations with native Clojure gRPC solutions:

- **Protojure limitations**: Missing enterprise features like automatic client reconnection, manual trailer handling requirements, and production scalability constraints
- **Ecosystem maturity**: Java interop provides full gRPC feature parity with better performance characteristics  
- **Industry adoption**: Companies like AppsFlyer (1000+ Clojure developers) demonstrate successful production-scale Java interop usage

## Decision

We will use **gRPC with Java interop** (grpc-java) for communication between Ooloi's frontend and backend components. The **shared project** will contain protocol definitions and gRPC dependencies, supporting three deployment models:

1. **Backend-only** binary (server only)
2. **Frontend-only** binary (client connecting to remote server)  
3. **Combined** binary (both client and server in same process)

In all cases, the backend component hosts the gRPC server while the frontend component acts as a gRPC client.

**Architectural Principle: API-gRPC Equivalence**
The gRPC interface will provide 1:1 correspondence with Ooloi's `api.clj` namespace. Every function in `api.clj` represents an operation designed for remote access and will have a corresponding gRPC method. This ensures the gRPC interface is comprehensive, consistent, and aligned with the intended public API - no more, no less.

## Rationale

### Core gRPC Benefits

1. **Performance**:
   - gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, a lightweight binary serialization format.
   - Offers significantly faster serialization and deserialisation compared to JSON.
   - Supports streaming, crucial for real-time updates of large scores.

2. **Language Agnostic**:
   - While we're using Clojure for both frontend and backend, gRPC's language-agnostic nature provides flexibility for future expansions or integrations.

3. **Bi-directional Streaming**:
   - Allows for efficient, real-time updates from backend to frontend.
   - Crucial for live collaboration features and real-time score rendering.

4. **Code Generation**:
   - Automatic client and server code generation from service definitions.
   - Reduces boilerplate and ensures consistency between client and server implementations.

5. **Compression**:
   - Built-in support for data compression, beneficial for transferring large musical scores.

6. **Multiplexing**:
   - Supports multiple simultaneous requests over a single connection.
   - Improves efficiency, especially important for complex score manipulations.

7. **Community and Ecosystem**:
   - Strong community support and a growing ecosystem.
   - Well-documented and actively maintained.

8. **Cross-platform Support**:
   - Works well across different operating systems, aligning with Ooloi's cross-platform goals.

9. **Future-proofing**:
    - Scalable architecture that can support future cloud-based deployments if needed.

### Java Interop Advantages (Updated July 2025)

1. **Production Maturity**: Full access to enterprise gRPC features including interceptors, deadlines, and advanced error handling
2. **Performance**: Better performance characteristics than native Clojure implementations  
3. **Feature Completeness**: Access to the entire gRPC Java ecosystem without waiting for Clojure-specific implementations
4. **Operational Reliability**: Proven in high-scale production environments
5. **Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Java tooling and monitoring solutions

### Integrant Integration

The Java interop approach integrates cleanly with Integrant for lifecycle management:

```clojure
(defmethod ig/init-key :ooloi/grpc-server [_ {:keys [piece-manager]}]
  (let [server (-> (ServerBuilder/forPort 5000)
                   (.addService 
                    (proxy [OoloiGrpc$OoloiImplBase] []
                      (createPiece [^CreatePieceRequest req ^StreamObserver observer]
                        ;; Delegate to pure Clojure business logic
                        (let [piece (api/create-piece piece-manager (.getName req))]
                          (-> (build-piece-response piece)
                              (->> (.onNext observer)))
                          (.onCompleted observer)))))
                   .build .start)]
    {:server server}))

(defmethod ig/halt-key! :ooloi/grpc-server [_ {:keys [server]}]
  (.shutdown server))

;; System configuration
{:ooloi/piece-manager {}
 :ooloi/grpc-server {:piece-manager (ig/ref :ooloi/piece-manager)}}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **High-performance communication** suitable for real-time score editing
- **Efficient handling** of large data structures (complex musical scores)
- **Complete API coverage** ensuring all `api.clj` functions are remotely accessible
- **Consistent interface** maintaining 1:1 correspondence between local and remote operations
- **Streamlined development process** with code generation and thin delegation layer
- **Deployment flexibility** supporting combined binaries or distributed client-server architectures
- **Flexibility** for future expansion to other platforms or languages
- **Production readiness** with full enterprise gRPC feature set from day one
- **Integrant integration** enabling clean lifecycle management and dependency injection
- **Ecosystem access** to the entire Java gRPC ecosystem
- **Performance optimisation** through mature Java implementations

### Negative

- **Learning curve** for developers not familiar with gRPC, Protocol Buffers, and Java interop
- **Slightly more complex setup** compared to REST APIs
- **Potential challenges in debugging** due to binary nature of communication
- **Interop complexity** requiring data conversion between Java objects and Clojure data structures
- **Additional dependencies** on Java gRPC libraries

### Mitigations

- Create Clojure wrapper functions for common gRPC operations
- Implement comprehensive logging at conversion boundaries  
- Develop testing patterns that work across the interop boundary
- Provide clear documentation and examples for the development team

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Dependencies and Build Configuration

All three projects include gRPC dependencies and generate Java classes from shared `.proto` files:

**Shared project** (`shared/project.clj`):
```clojure
:dependencies [;; Remove protojure (native Clojure approach):
               ; [protojure "1.6.1"]
               
               ;; Update protobuf version:
               [com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java "3.25.1"]  ; was 3.19.4
               
               ;; Add Java gRPC libraries:
               [io.grpc/grpc-netty "1.60.0"]
               [io.grpc/grpc-protobuf "1.60.0"] 
               [io.grpc/grpc-stub "1.60.0"]
               [integrant "0.13.0"]
               ;; existing dependencies...
               ]

:plugins [[lein-protoc "0.4.1"]
          ;; existing plugins...
          ]

:protoc {:proto-paths ["src/main/proto"]
         :output-path "target/generated-sources/grpc"
         :java-options {:language "java"}}

:java-source-paths ["target/generated-sources/grpc"]
```

**Backend project** (`backend/project.clj`):
```clojure
:dependencies [;; gRPC dependencies for server implementation:
               [io.grpc/grpc-netty "1.60.0"]
               [io.grpc/grpc-protobuf "1.60.0"] 
               [io.grpc/grpc-stub "1.60.0"]
               [com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java "3.25.1"]
               [integrant "0.13.0"]
               ;; existing dependencies...
               ]

:plugins [[lein-protoc "0.4.1"]
          ;; existing plugins...
          ]

;; Generate Java classes from shared .proto files:
:protoc {:proto-paths ["../shared/src/main/proto"]
         :output-path "target/generated-sources/grpc"
         :java-options {:language "java"}}

:java-source-paths ["target/generated-sources/grpc"]
```

**Frontend project** (`frontend/project.clj`):
```clojure
:dependencies [;; Remove protojure (native Clojure approach):
               ; [protojure "1.6.1"]
               
               ;; gRPC dependencies for client implementation:
               [io.grpc/grpc-netty "1.60.0"]
               [io.grpc/grpc-protobuf "1.60.0"] 
               [io.grpc/grpc-stub "1.60.0"]
               [com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java "3.25.1"]
               [integrant "0.13.0"]
               ;; existing dependencies...
               ]

:plugins [[lein-protoc "0.4.1"]
          ;; existing plugins...
          ]

;; Generate Java classes from shared .proto files:
:protoc {:proto-paths ["../shared/src/main/proto"]
         :output-path "target/generated-sources/grpc"
         :java-options {:language "java"}}

:java-source-paths ["target/generated-sources/grpc"]
```

This approach ensures each project can build independently while sharing `.proto` definitions and Clojure source code.

**Code Generation Feedback Loop:**
The build process creates a continuous feedback cycle:
1. Generate `.proto` files from `api.clj` namespace introspection
2. `lein-protoc` generates Java classes from Protocol Buffer definitions
3. gRPC server implementations delegate directly to existing `api.clj` functions
4. Frontend clients call generated stubs for 1:1 API correspondence

### 2. Define Protocol Buffer Messages and Services

Create comprehensive `.proto` files in `shared/src/main/proto/` for all shared data structures (e.g., musical elements, layout information) and service definitions. These will be used to generate classes for backend server implementation, frontend client usage, and combined deployments.

### 3. Code Generation Pipeline

Set up automated code generation for both frontend and backend using `lein-protoc` plugin, ensuring generated classes are included in the project classpath.

### 4. Backend gRPC Server Implementation

Implement gRPC server services in the backend using Integrant methods with proper dependency injection:

```clojure
(ns ooloi.backend.grpc.service
  (:require [integrant.core :as ig]
            [ooloi.backend.api :as api])
  (:import [io.grpc Server ServerBuilder]
           [io.grpc.stub StreamObserver]
           [ooloi.backend OoloiGrpc$OoloiImplBase]
           [ooloi.backend CreatePieceRequest Piece GetPieceRequest]))
```

The frontend will implement corresponding gRPC client code to make calls to these backend services.

### 5. Architectural Separation

- **Shared Project (`shared/`)**: Contains `.proto` files, generates Java gRPC classes, and supports building combined binaries with both client and server
- **Backend Component**: Implements gRPC server that delegates to existing `api.clj` functions, managed by Integrant
- **Frontend Component**: Makes client calls to backend server using generated classes  
- **API Layer (`api.clj`)**: Defines complete public interface - every function becomes a gRPC method
- **Thin gRPC Layer**: Handles only data conversion and transport, delegates all operations to `api.clj`
- **Data Conversion**: Efficient bidirectional conversion utilities between Protocol Buffers and Clojure data structures
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Same codebase supports combined deployment (single process) or distributed deployment (separate processes)

### 6. Backend Streaming Implementation

Implement bi-directional streaming in the backend server for real-time updates using gRPC's streaming capabilities with proper resource management and error handling. The frontend client will connect to these streams for real-time score updates.

### 7. Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms

Implement robust error handling using gRPC status codes with comprehensive retry mechanisms for resilient communication.

### 8. Testing Infrastructure

Develop comprehensive testing suites covering:
- Unit tests for backend service methods
- Integration tests for full client-server interactions between frontend and backend
- Performance tests for large score handling across the network
- Mock services for controlled testing environments
- Frontend client connection and error handling tests

### 9. Security Implementation

Implement TLS encryption and authentication mechanisms for all deployments, following a **security-first architecture**:

#### TLS Everywhere Policy

**Default Configuration:**
- **Default port**: 10700 ("OOLOI" backwards in leet-speak) for all environments
- **Production alternatives**: Port 443 for maximum firewall compatibility
- **Development**: TLS enabled by default
- **Production**: TLS required
- **Debugging**: Optional TLS disable via environment variable

**Port Strategy:**
- **Port 10700**: Default choice for all deployments
  - No root privileges required
  - Unique to Ooloi ("OOLOI" backwards in leet-speak)
  - Avoids conflicts with standard services
  - Consistent across development and production
- **Port 443**: Alternative for production environments requiring maximum compatibility
  - Firewall-friendly in corporate environments
  - No port specification needed for clients
  - Punch-through capability for NAT/proxy scenarios
- **Port 8443**: Alternative for "alternate HTTPS" without root privileges

**Certificate Management:**
- **Development**: Auto-generated self-signed certificates on first run
- **Production**: Standard CA-signed certificates or integration with external cert providers
- **Team Environment**: Shared development CA for consistent experience

**Development Tooling:**
```bash
# Standard development server (TLS enabled)
OOLOI_TLS=true OOLOI_PORT=10700 ./ooloi-server
./ooloi-server --tls=true

# Debugging server (TLS disabled)
OOLOI_TLS=false OOLOI_PORT=10700 ./ooloi-server  
./ooloi-server --tls=false

# Production server (TLS required)
OOLOI_TLS=true OOLOI_PORT=443 ./ooloi-server
./ooloi-server --port=443 --tls=true
```

**Build Tools:**
- `make dev-certs` - generates local development certificates

#### Security Benefits

1. **Development Parity**: TLS in development catches encryption-related issues early
2. **Security Habits**: Developers never accidentally transmit sensitive musical data in plaintext
3. **Production Readiness**: No "we'll add TLS later" technical debt
4. **Corporate Compatibility**: Port 443 ensures functionality in locked-down environments
5. **Team Scalability**: New developers get secure-by-default setup automatically

### 10. System Startup and Communication Flow

**Deployment Model 1: Combined Binary**
1. Single application starts with both backend and frontend components
2. Backend component starts gRPC server (typically localhost)
3. Frontend component connects as gRPC client to the same process
4. All communication happens in-process or via localhost

**Deployment Model 2: Separate Backend/Frontend**
1. Backend binary starts independently with gRPC server on configured port
2. Frontend binary starts independently as JavaFX application
3. Frontend gRPC client connects to backend server over network
4. Frontend makes gRPC calls to backend for all musical operations

**Deployment Model 3: Backend-only**
1. Backend binary starts with gRPC server
2. External clients (potentially future web frontend, mobile apps, etc.) connect to server
3. Useful for headless servers or API-only deployments

### 11. Monitoring and Observability

Set up gRPC-specific metrics collection and distributed tracing for production monitoring.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Protojure (Native Clojure)**: Rejected due to production limitations including missing enterprise features like automatic client reconnection, manual trailer handling requirements, and performance constraints in high-load scenarios.

2. **REST API with JSON**: Rejected due to performance concerns with large datasets, lack of native streaming support, and absence of strong typing for complex musical data structures.

3. **WebSocket**: Considered for its real-time capabilities but rejected due to lack of built-in type safety, less structured approach to API definition, and absence of sophisticated error handling mechanisms.

4. **Apache Thrift**: Similar benefits to gRPC but rejected due to gRPC's better language support, more active community, and superior streaming capabilities.

5. **Custom Binary Protocol**: Considered for maximum performance but rejected due to development overhead, lack of tooling, and reinvention of solved problems.

### Port Number Alternatives Considered

1. **Port 50051**: Standard gRPC convention, but generic and unmemorable for team
2. **Port 8080**: Common development port, but potential conflicts with other services
3. **Port 8443**: Good alternative HTTPS port, but lacks team significance
4. **Port 443**: Excellent for production compatibility, but requires root privileges in development
5. **Port 10700**: Chosen as default - memorable ("OOLOI" backwards in leet-speak), no conflicts, no root required

### TLS Implementation Alternatives Considered

1. **Production-only TLS**: Rejected due to development/production parity concerns and potential security issues
2. **Optional TLS everywhere**: Rejected due to complexity and potential for insecure defaults
3. **TLS with manual certificate management**: Rejected due to developer friction and setup complexity
4. **TLS with auto-generated certificates**: Chosen for balance of security and developer experience

## Implementation Status

This decision reflects lessons learned from comprehensive gRPC ecosystem analysis conducted in 2024-2025, replacing any previous assumptions about using native Clojure gRPC libraries. The Java interop approach provides the reliability, performance characteristics, and feature completeness required for Ooloi's production deployment.

The choice prioritises production reliability and operational maturity over development convenience, whilst maintaining Ooloi's functional programming principles through careful architectural separation.

## Notes

While this approach requires additional interop handling compared to native Clojure solutions, the trade-off strongly favours production reliability and feature completeness. The Integrant-based architecture ensures that gRPC concerns remain properly isolated from business logic, maintaining clean separation of transport and domain concerns.

The implementation should monitor performance and developer experience in practice. Should unexpected complexities or performance issues arise, this decision may need reevaluation, though the current evidence strongly supports the Java interop approach for production systems.

We should also monitor the evolution of gRPC and related technologies, particularly any improvements to native Clojure implementations, to ensure we continue using the most effective communication method as the project scales.
