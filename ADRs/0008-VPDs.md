# ADR: Implementation of Vector Path Descriptors (VPDs)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Ooloi deals with complex, hierarchical musical structures that need to be efficiently referenced, manipulated, and communicated between different parts of the system. We need a way to uniquely identify and address specific elements within a musical score, from high-level structures like instruments and staves down to individual notes and articulations. This addressing system needs to be compact, efficient, and flexible enough to handle both the musical and visual hierarchies of a score.

## Decision

We will implement Vector Path Descriptors (VPDs) as the primary method for addressing and referencing elements within Ooloi's musical structures. VPDs are essentially navigators and can be used directly by Specter and functions like `get-in` to navigate arbitrarily nested maps and vectors.

## Rationale

1. Consistency: VPDs provide a uniform way to reference elements across different parts of the codebase.
2. Efficiency: They allow for compact representation of paths, which is especially useful in communication between frontend and backend.
3. Flexibility: VPDs can easily accommodate both musical and visual hierarchies.
4. Scalability: As the project grows, VPDs make it easier to add new operations without changing the fundamental way of addressing elements.
5. Transaction support: VPDs work seamlessly with Ooloi's transaction system, ensuring operations are performed within the context of the current piece transaction.
6. Integration with existing tools: VPDs can be easily used with libraries like Specter for powerful data structure traversal and manipulation.

## VPD Structure and Examples

VPDs are vectors that describe a path to a specific element within the nested structure of a Ooloi piece. They use a combination of keywords and indices to navigate the piece structure. In API calls, VPDs are used as the first argument, followed by a Piece or PieceID, and then any additional arguments.

### Basic VPD Structure

```clojure
[:keyword1 index1 :keyword2 index2 ... :keywordN indexN]
```

### Examples

1. Accessing a specific measure:
   ```clojure
   [:musicians 0 :instruments 1 :staves 0 :voices 0 :measures 3]
   ```
   This VPD points to the 4th measure of the first voice of the first staff of the second instrument of the first musician.

2. Accessing a layout element:
   ```clojure
   [:layouts 0 :page-views 2 :system-views 1 :staff-views 0 :measure-views 3]
   ```
   This points to the 4th measure view of the first staff view of the second system view of the third page view of the first layout.

3. Compact form for brevity:
   ```clojure
   [:m 0 1 0 0 3]  ; Equivalent to [:musicians 0 :instruments 1 :staves 0 :voices 0 :measures 3]
   [:l 0 2 1 0 3]  ; Equivalent to [:layouts 0 :page-views 2 :system-views 1 :staff-views 0 :measure-views 3]
   ```

4. Accessing items within a measure:
   ```clojure
   [:m 0 1 0 0 3 :items 2]  ; The 3rd item in the specified measure
   [:m 0 1 0 0 3 :items :pitch]  ; All pitches in the specified measure
   [:m 0 1 0 0 3 :items #(instance? Chord %)]  ; All chords in the specified measure
   ```

5. Nested structures (e.g., tuplets):
   ```clojure
   [:m 0 1 0 0 3 :items :tuplet 0 :items 1]  ; The 2nd item in the first tuplet of the specified measure
   ```

## Usage Examples

1. Adding an articulation:
   ```clojure
   (add-articulation [:m 0 1 0 0 3] piece-id :staccato)
   ```
   This adds a staccato articulation to all notes in the specified measure.

2. Getting a specific note:
   ```clojure
   (get-item [:m 0 1 0 0 3 :items 2] piece)
   ```
   This retrieves the third item in the specified measure.

3. Updating a layout element:
   ```clojure
   (set-staff-spacing [:l 0 2 1] piece-id 20)
   ```
   This sets the staff spacing for the second system view of the third page view in the first layout to 20.

4. Querying all pitches in a measure:
   ```clojure
   (filter-items [:m 0 1 0 0 3] piece :pitch)
   ```
   This returns all pitch items in the specified measure.

5. Setting a property of a specific element:
   ```clojure
   (set-duration [:m 0 1 0 0 3 :items 2] piece [1/4 2])
   (set-duration [:m 0 1 0 0 3 :items 3] piece 1/16)
   ```
   This sets the duration of the third and fourth items in the specified measure to a double-dotted quarter note and a sixteenth, respectively.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Unified addressing scheme across the entire application.
- Simplified API for accessing and modifying score elements.
- Efficient communication of element references between frontend and backend.
- Easier implementation of operations like copy/paste, drag-and-drop, and undo/redo.
- Seamless integration with Ooloi's transaction system.

### Negative

- Learning curve for developers to understand and use VPDs effectively.
- Potential for invalid paths if not properly validated.
- May require custom serialization/deserialization for persistence and network communication.

## Implementation Approach

1. Define a clear syntax for VPDs, including support for both verbose and compact forms.
2. Implement core functions for creating, validating, and resolving VPDs.
3. Integrate VPDs with Specter for efficient traversal and manipulation of score structures.
4. Develop a system for partial VPDs to handle relative addressing within nested structures.
5. Implement serialization and deserialization methods for VPDs, ensuring compatibility with the chosen inter-process communication system (gRPC).
6. Create utility functions for common VPD operations (e.g., parent path, child paths, sibling paths).
7. Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed paths to improve performance.
8. Develop comprehensive testing suites for VPD creation, resolution, and manipulation.
9. Extend the `retrieve` function to handle new selectors for measure contents.
10. Create helper functions for common operations on measure contents, such as filtering items by type or applying a predicate.
11. Update API functions to use the pattern of (function-name vpd piece-or-id ...other-args).
12. Update documentation to explain how to use VPDs, including the extended syntax for measure contents.

## Alternatives Considered

1. String-based Paths: Rejected due to less efficient parsing and higher verbosity.
2. Integer-based Indexing: Rejected due to lack of clarity and difficulty in representing complex hierarchies.
3. Object References: Rejected due to issues with serialization and communication between frontend and backend.

## Reference Implementation

The VPD system is implemented in [`ooloi.shared.ops.vpd`](/shared/src/main/clojure/ooloi/shared/ops/vpd.clj), which provides functions for converting, canonicalizing, and using VPDs.

## Related Decisions

- [ADR-0010: Pure Trees](0010-Pure-Trees.md) - VPDs are designed to work efficiently with the pure tree structure
- [ADR-0014: Timewalk](0014-Timewalk.md) - Timewalk operations use VPDs extensively for boundary specification and results  
- [ADR-0002: gRPC](0002-gRPC.md) - VPDs are used in gRPC communication to identify change locations

## Notes

- We should develop clear guidelines for when to use verbose vs. compact VPD forms.
- Consider implementing a VPD parser that can convert between string representations and vector forms for easier manual input and debugging.
- Explore the possibility of using VPDs in user-facing features, such as a command palette or scripting interface, to allow advanced users direct access to score elements.
- Pay special attention to performance optimizations for very large scores.
- Carefully design the system for handling dynamic structures within measures (e.g., nested tuplets, grace notes).
- Consider potential extensions for future musical concepts or structures.
- Develop debugging tools that can visualize VPDs within the context of a score, aiding in development and troubleshooting.
- Regularly benchmark VPD operations against direct object manipulation to ensure there's no significant performance hit.
- Implement robust error handling for invalid paths, both for developer usability and to prevent potential security issues.
- Ensure that all API functions consistently use the pattern of (function-name vpd piece-or-id ...other-args) for clarity and consistency.
