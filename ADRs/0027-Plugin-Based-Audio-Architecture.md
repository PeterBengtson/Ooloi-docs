## Context

Ooloi requires a sophisticated audio architecture capable of handling advanced musical notation, microtonal compositions, and nuanced humanisation. The system's frontend-backend separation, where backends may run in cloud environments, requires that all audio processing occurs on frontend clients rather than server infrastructure.

### Historical Context: Igor Engraver's Approach (1996-2001)

Twenty-five years ago, Igor Engraver achieved sophisticated music notation playback by seizing complete control of MIDI units. The system employed pitch bend manipulation for microtonal accuracy, distributing notes across MIDI channels using register allocation algorithms borrowed from compiler technology. In chords containing microtonally altered notes, each note played on different channels with dynamic patch changes and no fixed instrument-to-channel relationships - a "DNA soup" of resource allocation that extracted capabilities beyond MIDI's nominal sixteen-channel limit.

Igor incorporated advanced humanisation including realistic instrumental limitations, orchestral section rhythmic hierarchies, and sophisticated performance characteristics such as four-millisecond temporal offsets between soloists and accompaniment. However, these innovations operated within MIDI's protocol constraints: limited channel allocation, 7-bit controller resolution, and complex device-specific compatibility requirements.

Ooloi's plugin-based architecture addresses the same musical intelligence requirements while eliminating the protocol constraints that required Igor's elaborate workarounds.

### Frontend-Backend Audio Separation

**Backend Responsibilities** (ADR-0001: Frontend-Backend Separation):
- Musical data management and storage
- Real-time collaboration coordination
- Paintlist generation and caching
- No audio processing or MIDI handling

**Frontend Client Responsibilities**:
- All audio input and output processing
- MIDI keyboard input handling and translation to musical commands
- Plugin hosting and audio generation
- Local playback coordination and synchronization

**Cloud Deployment Considerations**:
- Backend services may run on cloud infrastructure (AWS, etc.)
- Audio streaming from cloud to clients impractical for latency and bandwidth
- Local client audio processing provides responsive user experience
- MIDI input requires low-latency local processing for practical music entry

### Technical Requirements

**Contemporary Music Support**:
- Arbitrary microtonal deviations with precise control beyond MIDI's 16-channel limitations
- Complex dynamic instructions like "sffzp < f > pp" requiring multiple coordinated parameter changes
- Advanced articulation techniques for contemporary composition and professional sample library integration
- Collaborative microtonal editing with consistent playback across clients

**Professional and Educational Deployment**:
- High-quality orchestral playback for classroom demonstrations without server audio streaming
- Professional-grade mock-ups for composition work using industry-standard tools
- Multi-user synchronized playback with advanced humanisation in classroom environments
- Integration with existing professional music production workflows and sample libraries

**Architectural Consistency**: Following Ooloi's commitment to modern standards (SMuFL fonts, plugin architecture from ADR-0003, contemporary collaboration features), audio functionality should use current professional tools rather than accommodate legacy protocol limitations.

## Decision

The Ooloi core provides no audio or MIDI output. All playback and output are delegated to frontend plugins. The only audio-related functionality in the core is MIDI (and MPE) input handling for note entry, which the frontend translates into API commands for the backend.

### Core Architecture

**Complete Frontend Audio Responsibility**: All audio processing occurs on frontend clients
- **Plugin architecture**: Frontend clients host all audio plugins (VST/AU, MIDI, synthesis, etc.)
- **Local processing**: Audio generation and processing handled locally for responsive performance
- **No server audio**: Backend provides no audio capabilities, suitable for cloud deployment
- **Client independence**: Each client manages its own audio setup and plugin configuration

**Backend Audio Separation**: Backend provides no audio processing
- **Musical data only**: Backend handles musical structure, collaboration, and paintlist generation
- **No MIDI processing**: Backend never receives or processes MIDI data
- **No audio streaming**: No audio data transmitted from backend to clients
- **Cloud compatibility**: Backend suitable for deployment on cloud infrastructure without audio capabilities

**MIDI Input Processing**: Local keyboard input with command translation
- **Frontend responsibility**: MIDI keyboards connect to frontend clients, not backend
- **Local interpretation**: Clients translate MIDI input to musical commands locally
- **API communication**: Musical commands sent to backend via gRPC API calls
- **Collaborative updates**: MIDI-derived musical changes propagated to other clients through backend

**Plugin Audio Architecture**: Multiple audio strategies available through frontend plugins

- **Platform audio**: Native audio capabilities handled by frontend on each target platform
- **User interface**: Audio plugin configuration and management integrated with frontend user interface

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Built-in VST/AU Hosting

**Approach**: Integrate VST/AU hosting directly into Ooloi core

**Rejection Reasons**:
- **Architectural complexity**: Audio threading and resource management complicate core system design
- **Platform dependencies**: Audio library requirements increase deployment complexity across platforms  
- **Maintenance burden**: Audio troubleshooting becomes core system responsibility
- **Feature constraints**: Single audio approach limits user workflow options

### Built-in MIDI Output

**Approach**: Include MIDI output capabilities in core system

**Rejection Reasons**:
- **Protocol constraints**: MIDI channel and controller limitations reduce musical expression possibilities
- **Implementation overhead**: MIDI device management and channel allocation add complexity
- **User workflow mismatch**: Many users prefer plugin-based audio production workflows
- **Compatibility requirements**: Device-specific MIDI implementations require ongoing maintenance

### Hybrid Core/Plugin Audio

**Approach**: Basic audio capabilities in core with plugin extensions for advanced features

**Rejection Reasons**:
- **Inconsistent user experience**: Different capability levels create confusing audio behavior
- **Development duplication**: Audio features require implementation in both core and plugin systems
- **Architectural compromise**: Partial audio support in core creates unclear separation of responsibilities
- **Maintenance complexity**: Audio bugs potentially affect both core stability and plugin ecosystem

### Custom Audio Engine

**Approach**: Develop proprietary audio synthesis and processing engine

**Rejection Reasons**:
- **Development scope**: Custom audio engine development diverts resources from notation system goals
- **User expectations**: Musicians expect integration with existing professional tools and libraries
- **Market fragmentation**: Proprietary audio format reduces interoperability with professional workflows
- **Ongoing maintenance**: Audio engine maintenance competes with core notation system development

All these alternatives converge on the same principle: playback belongs in plugins, not in the core.

## Conclusion

Plugin-based audio architecture positions Ooloi as a forward-looking professional notation system capable of serving contemporary music, educational applications, and collaborative workflows. By completely separating audio processing to frontend clients through plugins, the architecture eliminates the constraints that plagued Igor Engraver's sophisticated MIDI approach while enabling cloud deployment and professional audio integration.

This architectural approach takes the core innovations behind Igor Engraver's advanced humanisation and microtonal capabilities - the musical intelligence, sophisticated performance characteristics, and understanding of orchestral behavior - and re-implements them for modern technology and collaborative contexts. Where Igor's "DNA soup" required workarounds within MIDI's 16-channel constraints, Ooloi's plugin architecture provides unlimited precision and parameter control. Where Igor's advanced humanisation was constrained by MIDI controller resolution, plugins offer direct access to sample library parameters and articulation systems.

The architectural decision reflects Ooloi's commitment to modern standards and professional capabilities, ensuring that musical notation serves musical requirements rather than being constrained by protocol limitations. Frontend clients handle all audio complexity through flexible plugin architecture, while the backend focuses purely on musical data management and collaboration coordination. The result preserves and extends Igor's pioneering approach to musical intelligence while eliminating the technical constraints that limited its full expression.
