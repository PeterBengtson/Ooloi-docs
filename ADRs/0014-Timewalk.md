## Status

Accepted

## Context

Ooloi requires sophisticated traversal capabilities for its hierarchical musical structures to support critical applications including MIDI playback, visual layout, attachment resolution, and collaborative editing. The system faces several key challenges:

1. **Temporal Coordination**: Musical pieces require traversal that respects temporal ordering - all events at measure N must be processed before any events at measure N+1 across all voices and instruments.

2. **Polyphonic Complexity**: Modern musical scores contain multiple simultaneous voices that must be synchronized during traversal while maintaining their individual structural integrity.

3. **Scope-Limited Operations**: Different operations require traversal of specific subsets of the piece (single instrument, staff, voice, or measure range) without processing irrelevant portions.

4. **Performance Requirements**: Large orchestral scores with hundreds of thousands of musical elements demand efficient traversal that can terminate early and filter elements without full tree processing.

5. **Multiple Application Domains**: The same traversal mechanism must support fundamentally different operations including MIDI event generation, visual layout calculations, attachment endpoint resolution, and collaborative change propagation.

6. **Memory Constraints**: Professional scores can contain millions of elements, requiring memory-efficient processing that avoids intermediate collections.

7. **Computational-Musical Alignment**: Traditional music software forces musical concepts into object hierarchies, creating impedance mismatch between musical thinking and computational thinking. Ooloi requires an abstraction where musical concepts **are** the computational primitives.

## Decision

We implement a comprehensive timewalk system based on temporal coordination principles, using transducer-based traversal with boundary-VPD scope limiting. The system provides "measure N across all voices before measure N+1" traversal guarantees while supporting efficient filtering, early termination, and scope limitation.

## Paradigm Shift: Musical Time as Computational Foundation

The timewalk system represents a fundamental shift from **object-oriented musical manipulation** to **temporal stream processing**. Rather than treating musical time as a byproduct of object relationships, Ooloi makes temporal coordination the foundational abstraction for all musical computation.

### The Core Transformation: Piece → Stream

At its essence, timewalk performs a single conceptual transformation:

**A hierarchical piece structure becomes a temporal stream of musical events.**

This seemingly simple transformation has profound implications:

**Philosophically:** Musical time becomes the primary computational abstraction, not an emergent property of spatial structure. The score as a physical object (spatial hierarchy) dissolves into music as a temporal phenomenon (event stream). This aligns computational thinking with musical thinking—we experience music as events unfolding in time, not as nested containers of objects.

**Practically:** Operations that were complex graph traversals with manual synchronization become simple stream transformations with automatic temporal coordination. Finding "all forte passages" transforms from "recursively search tree, track positions, correlate across voices" into "filter stream for forte dynamics." The complexity collapses because you're working with the natural structure of music itself.

**Architecturally:** Every musical operation—MIDI generation, visual layout, harmonic analysis, attachment resolution—becomes a stream transformation. This unification means one well-designed abstraction serves all musical computation, and new operations compose naturally from existing primitives without architectural changes.

This transforms musical software development:

- **Musical relationships become stream transformations** rather than pointer manipulations
- **Complex operations emerge** from composition of simple temporal filters
- **Mathematical guarantees** apply to musical computation through functional composition
- **Problem domains unify** under temporal stream processing (MIDI, layout, analysis, attachments)
- **Musical intent maps directly** to computational expressions without translation overhead
- **Domain expertise becomes executable code** rather than being lost in abstraction layers

### From Imperative to Temporal-Functional

**Traditional Approach** (imperative object manipulation):
```clojure
;; Navigate object graph, modify state
(doseq [musician (get-musicians piece)]
  (doseq [instrument (get-instruments musician)]
    (when (violin? instrument)
      (transpose-instrument! instrument 4))))
```

**Ooloi Approach** (temporal stream processing):
```clojure
;; Define transformations, compose operations
(into []
      (comp (timewalk {})
            (filter #(violin-instrument? (item %)))
            (filter pitch?)
            (map #(transpose-pitch (item %) 4)))
      [piece])
```

The temporal approach eliminates impedance mismatch—musical thinking and computational thinking become isomorphic.

## Dual-Arity API Pattern Decision

The `timewalk` function follows the established Clojure pattern used by core functions like `map`, `filter`, and `take`, providing two distinct arities:

```clojure
;; 2-arity: Returns lazy sequence directly
(timewalk piece {:boundary-vpd [:m 0 0]})

;; 1-arity: Returns transducer for composition
(sequence (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd staff-boundary})
                (filter pitch?)
                (take 10))
          [piece])
```

This dual-arity design provides significant architectural benefits:

**1. Consistency with Clojure Ecosystem**
Following the same pattern as `map`, `filter`, `remove`, and other core functions creates intuitive APIs that Clojure developers understand immediately. This reduces cognitive load and learning curve.

**2. Flexibility in Usage Patterns**
- **Direct lazy sequences** for simple exploratory analysis and REPL development
- **Transducer composition** for complex processing pipelines with multiple transformation steps
- **Performance optimization** through transducer composition without intermediate collections

**3. Composability with Standard Library**
The transducer form enables seamless composition with all of Clojure's transducer-aware functions:
```clojure
;; Compose with any transducer-aware context
(into [] (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd voice-vpd}) (filter pitch?)) [piece])
(sequence (timewalk options) pieces)  ; Process multiple pieces
(transduce (timewalk options) conj [] [piece])  ; Direct reduction
```

**4. Future-Proof Architecture**
The transducer form naturally supports emerging Clojure contexts like core.async channels, allowing musical processing in concurrent or streaming scenarios without API changes.

This design decision ensures that `timewalk` integrates naturally with both simple and complex musical processing workflows while maintaining the performance characteristics required for large orchestral scores.

## Transducer Architecture Decision

### Why Clojure Transducers?

Clojure transducers provide the optimal solution for Ooloi's timewalk due to several critical advantages:

**1. Composable Processing Pipelines**
Transducers enable elegant composition of operations without intermediate collections:
```clojure
(comp (filter pitch?)
      (map pitch->midi-note)
      (take-while #(< (:time %) end-time)))
```
This composes filtering, transformation, and early termination into a single efficient pipeline.

**2. Memory Efficiency**
Unlike sequence operations that create intermediate collections, transducers process elements one at a time, crucial for large orchestral scores:
- No intermediate vectors for filtered results
- Constant memory usage regardless of piece size
- Streaming-compatible for real-time applications

**3. Early Termination Support**
Transducers naturally support early termination through `take`, `take-while`, etc., essential for:
- MIDI playback of score sections
- Layout calculations that stop at page boundaries
- Interactive editing that processes only visible measures

**4. Process-Agnostic Design**
The same transducer works with different collection types and processing contexts:
- Lazy sequences for exploratory analysis
- Reduced operations for aggregation
- Channel processing for concurrent applications

### Alternative Approaches Considered and Rejected

**1. Sequence-Based Processing (map, filter, etc.)**
```clojure
;; Rejected approach
(->> (get-all-items piece)
     (filter pitch?)
     (map pitch->midi-note)
     (take 1000))
```
**Why Rejected:**
- Creates intermediate collections at each step
- Memory usage grows linearly with piece size
- No early termination until final step
- Poor performance for large orchestral scores

**2. Recursive Tree Walking with Higher-Order Functions**
```clojure
;; Rejected approach - demonstrates temporal coordination problem
(defn walk-tree [piece filter-fn transform-fn]
  (for [musician (get-musicians piece)      ; Process ALL of musician 0
        instrument (get-instruments musician) ; then ALL of musician 1, etc.
        staff (get-staves instrument)
        voice (get-voices staff)
        measure (get-measures voice)        ; Gets ALL measures of voice 0
        item (get-items measure)            ; before ANY measures of voice 1
        :when (filter-fn item)]
    (transform-fn item)))
```
**Why Rejected:**
- **Breaks temporal coordination** - processes all measures of voice 1 before any of voice 2
- Difficult to compose multiple operations
- No built-in early termination
- Hard to unit test individual transformation steps
- Returns results in voice-by-voice order rather than temporal order

**3. Visitor Pattern Implementation**
```clojure
;; Rejected approach
(defprotocol ItemVisitor
  (visit-pitch [this pitch])
  (visit-chord [this chord])
  (visit-rest [this rest]))
```
**Why Rejected:**
- Object-oriented approach conflicts with Clojure's functional philosophy
- Poor composability - each visitor is monolithic
- Difficult to implement early termination
- Complex to extend for new musical element types

**4. Core.async Channels**
```clojure
;; Rejected approach
(defn walk-piece-async [piece]
  (let [ch (chan 1000)]
    (go (doseq [item (get-all-items piece)]
          (>! ch item)))
    ch))
```
**Why Rejected:**
- Unnecessary complexity for synchronous operations
- Channel buffering decisions complicate memory management
- Temporal coordination requires complex channel coordination
- Overkill for most timewalk use cases

**5. Custom Iterator/Generator Protocol**
```clojure
;; Rejected approach
(defprotocol PieceIterator
  (next-item [this])
  (has-next? [this]))
```
**Why Rejected:**
- Stateful design conflicts with functional programming principles
- Poor composability with other Clojure operations
- Complex to implement temporal coordination correctly
- Difficult to test and reason about state transitions

### Single Unified Transducer Architecture

**Critical Design Decision: One Transducer for All Applications**

Rather than creating separate traversal systems for MIDI generation, visual layout, attachment resolution, and analysis, Ooloi implements a **single unified timewalk transducer** that serves all these domains. This architectural choice provides several crucial advantages:

**1. Temporal Consistency Across All Operations**
Every application automatically inherits the same temporal coordination guarantee:
```clojure
;; MIDI, layout, and attachment resolution all use the same temporal ordering
(sequence (comp (timewalk boundary-vpd) midi-transducer) [piece])    ; Temporal order preserved
(sequence (comp (timewalk boundary-vpd) layout-transducer) [piece])  ; Same temporal order
(sequence (comp (timewalk boundary-vpd) attach-transducer) [piece])  ; Same temporal order
```

**2. Reduced Complexity and Maintenance**
- Single algorithm to test, debug, and optimize
- No risk of inconsistent temporal behavior between different systems
- Unified API for all musical traversal needs
- Single point of optimization benefits all applications

**3. Composable Cross-Domain Operations**
Applications can combine concerns within a single traversal:
```clojure
;; Generate MIDI while calculating layout metrics
(sequence (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd nil})
                (map (juxt item->midi-event calculate-width))
                (filter first)  ; Only items that generate MIDI
                (map (fn [[midi width]] {:midi midi :width width})))
          [piece])
```

**4. Guaranteed Behavioral Consistency**
- MIDI playback and visual display show identical temporal ordering
- Attachment resolution finds the same endpoints regardless of context
- Analysis results are consistent with user's visual experience
- Eliminates entire classes of synchronization bugs

**Why Not Separate Systems?**

Alternative approaches with domain-specific traversals would create:
- **Temporal Drift**: MIDI and layout could process measures in different orders
- **Maintenance Burden**: Multiple algorithms requiring separate optimization
- **Inconsistent Behavior**: Users experiencing different temporal behavior in different contexts
- **Duplicate Code**: Similar traversal logic repeated across domains
- **Testing Complexity**: Need to verify temporal consistency across multiple systems

### Transducer-Specific Advantages for Musical Applications

**1. Temporal Coordination Preservation**
Transducers maintain the temporal ordering guarantee while allowing arbitrary transformations:
```clojure
(sequence (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd [:musicians 0]})
                (filter chord?)
                (map extract-harmony))
          [piece])
;; Still processes measure 1 chords before measure 2 chords
```

**2. MIDI Streaming Compatibility**
Transducers naturally support real-time MIDI generation:
```clojure
(sequence (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd nil})
                (map item->midi-event)
                (remove nil?)
                (take-while #(< (:time %) playback-end)))
          [piece])
```

**3. Layout Calculation Optimization**
Visual layout can terminate early when page capacity is reached:
```clojure
(sequence (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd nil})
                (map calculate-item-width)
                (scan +)  ; Running width total
                (take-while #(< % page-width)))
          [piece])
```

**4. Attachment Resolution Efficiency**
Find attachment endpoints without processing entire piece:
```clojure
(first
  (sequence (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd attachment-scope})
                  (filter #(= (:end-id %) target-id))
                  (take 1))  ; Stop after finding endpoint
            [piece]))
```

## Detailed Design

### 1. Core Algorithm: Temporal Breadth-First Traversal

The timewalk provides temporal coordination through a breadth-first traversal strategy:

**Temporal Ordering Guarantee:**
- All musical events at measure N are processed before any events at measure N+1
- Within each measure, all voices are traversed completely
- Items are pushed directly to the reducing function as discovered (zero intermediate allocation)
- Early termination propagates immediately via reduced values

**Scope Limitation:**
- Boundary-VPD constrains traversal to specific portions of the piece
- Only measures within the specified scope are discovered and processed
- Efficient indexing enables O(1) measure lookup after initial discovery

### 2. Boundary-VPD Scope Limiting

The system uses Vector Path Descriptors (VPDs) to define traversal boundaries. **VPDs are always specified in compact form** (with `:m` or `:l` prefixes) throughout the API:

```clojure
;; Full piece traversal
{:boundary-vpd nil}

;; Single musician traversal
{:boundary-vpd [:m 2]}

;; Single instrument traversal
{:boundary-vpd [:m 0 1]}

;; Single staff traversal
{:boundary-vpd [:m 0 1 0]}
```

Boundary-VPDs provide precise control over traversal scope while maintaining the temporal coordination guarantee within the specified boundary.

**VPD Format in Timewalk:**
- **Input**: Accepts both compact (`[:m 0 1 0]`) and navigator (`[:musicians 0 :instruments 1 :staves 0]`) boundaries
- **Output**: Always returns compact VPDs in result tuples `[item vpd position]`
- **Internal**: Navigator form only used internally for Specter operations when needed

Timewalk results always contain compact VPDs, making them efficient for transmission and storage. Use VPD accessors (`vpd/measure`, `vpd/voice`, etc.) to extract information from result VPDs - these work with both compact and navigator forms.

### 3. Transducer Integration Examples

```clojure
;; MIDI generation with early termination
(sequence (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd [:m 0]})
                (filter rhythmic-item?)
                (map item->midi-event)
                (remove nil?)
                (take-while #(< (:time %) end-time)))
          [piece])

;; Harmonic analysis with filtering
(into #{}
      (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd nil})
            (filter chord?)
            (map extract-harmony))
      [piece])

;; Layout calculation with running totals
(sequence (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd [:m 0 0]})
                (map calculate-width)
                (scan +)
                (take-while #(< % page-width)))
          [piece])
```

### 4. Deep Traversal Support

The walker performs deep traversal within each measure, finding all nested items including:
- Direct measure items (rests, pitches, chords)
- Tuplet-contained items (items within tuplets)
- Tremolando-contained items (items within tremolandos)
- Arbitrarily nested structures

This ensures complete temporal coordination across all musical elements regardless of their nesting level.

## Key Applications

### Cross-Domain Pattern Unification

The timewalk demonstrates that diverse musical operations share identical computational patterns:

```clojure
;; Attachment endpoints: temporal stream → filter by ID → first match
(first (sequence (comp (timewalk scope) (filter has-endpoint-id?) (take 1)) [piece]))

;; Visual formatting: temporal stream → filter by span → map coordinates  
(sequence (comp (timewalk scope) (filter within-slur?) (map pitch->coordinates)) [piece])

;; MIDI generation: temporal stream → map to events → maintain time order
(sequence (comp (timewalk scope) (map item->midi-event) (remove nil?)) [piece])

;; Harmonic analysis: temporal stream → group by simultaneity → analyze
(sequence (comp (timewalk scope) (group-by measure-position) (map analyze-harmony)) [piece])

;; Layout calculation: temporal stream → map to widths → accumulate
(sequence (comp (timewalk scope) (map calculate-width) (scan +)) [piece])
```

This pattern unification proves that **musical time is the correct organizing principle** for musical computation. Complex musical operations reduce to temporal stream operations with different predicates and transformations.

### 1. MIDI Playback Generation

The temporal coordination guarantee directly solves MIDI's core requirement for time-ordered event streams:

- **Temporal Order**: All MIDI events at measure N emit before any at measure N+1
- **Polyphonic Support**: Natural handling of multiple simultaneous voices
- **Partial Playback**: Boundary-VPD enables instrument/staff-specific playback
- **Real-time Streaming**: Transducer composition supports efficient event generation

### 2. Visual Layout Calculation

The walker provides the foundation for professional music engraving:

- **System Layout**: Temporal coordination ensures measures align properly across staves
- **Page Breaking**: Early termination when page capacity is reached
- **Scope-Limited Layout**: Boundary-VPD enables partial re-layout after edits
- **Performance Optimization**: Avoid processing off-screen content

### 3. Attachment Resolution

Musical attachments (slurs, hairpins, ties) require endpoint resolution across temporal boundaries:

- **Cross-Measure Attachments**: Temporal traversal finds endpoints in later measures
- **Scope Awareness**: Boundary-VPD prevents attachment resolution outside relevant scope
- **Efficient Processing**: Early termination when all endpoints are found

### 4. Collaborative Editing

Multi-user editing requires precise change propagation:

- **Temporal Change Ordering**: Ensure changes apply in correct temporal sequence
- **Scope-Limited Updates**: Boundary-VPD enables efficient partial updates
- **Conflict Resolution**: Temporal coordination assists in resolving editing conflicts

### 5. Analysis and Export

Musical analysis tools require comprehensive piece traversal:

- **Harmonic Analysis**: Temporal coordination for chord progression analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Complete piece traversal with filtering
- **Format Export**: MusicXML, MIDI, and other format generation

## Rationale

1. **Temporal Coordination**: The "measure N before measure N+1" guarantee is fundamental to musical applications and distinguishes this system from generic tree traversal.

2. **Transducer Architecture**: Leverages Clojure's composable, efficient data transformation model while maintaining the temporal guarantee.

3. **Memory Efficiency**: Transducers avoid intermediate collections, crucial for large orchestral scores.

4. **Composability**: Different operations compose naturally without performance penalties.

5. **Boundary-VPD Integration**: Reuses Ooloi's existing VPD addressing system for intuitive scope specification.

6. **Performance Focus**: Early termination and filtering capabilities handle large orchestral scores efficiently.

7. **Multi-Application Support**: Single traversal mechanism serves diverse use cases from MIDI to layout to analysis.

8. **Mathematical Foundation**: Functional composition provides mathematical guarantees for musical computation.

## Implementation Notes

The timewalk transducer achieves true zero-allocation traversal through three key optimizations:

1. **Non-Consing Transducer Architecture**: The implementation uses a push-based reducing function that calls the downstream reducer directly as items are discovered, eliminating all intermediate lazy sequence allocation. Early termination (via `reduced?`) propagates immediately, stopping traversal the moment a terminal condition is met.

   This represents a true transducer implementation: it transforms reducing functions rather than producing sequences. Unlike lazy pull-based approaches that generate values on demand, this push-based producer drives the reducing function as items are discovered, enabling early termination to stop *computation itself*, not just sequence consumption.

2. **Temporal Measure Bucketing**: To provide "measure N across all voices before measure N+1" ordering, the walker collects measures in structural order (depth-first through the hierarchy), then builds a lookup map grouping measures by their temporal index. This transforms what would be O(M×K) repeated scans (M measure numbers × K total measures) into O(K) map construction + O(M) constant-time lookups. The map only contains measures within the specified boundary-vpd scope, not the entire piece.

3. **Voice-Level Position Tracking**: Position accumulation within voices correctly handles tuplet scaling by recursively calculating the scaled total duration of tuplet children before advancing the voice position. This prevents position drift when items follow tuplets in the voice sequence.

These optimizations maintain ratio precision (no tick quantization) while enabling efficient processing of large orchestral scores with proper early termination semantics. The implementation demonstrates how transducers can be applied beyond simple collection transformations to complex domain-specific algorithms while maintaining constant space, functional purity, and composability.

## Architectural Validation

The timewalk's success across multiple domains validates the core architectural insight: **when you find the right abstraction for a domain, complex problems become simple applications of fundamental patterns**.

This creates a **composable musical computing platform** where:

- **Attachment resolution** and **visual formatting** use identical temporal stream patterns
- **Complex features emerge naturally** from existing abstractions without new architecture
- **Musical intent maps directly** to computational expressions
- **Domain expertise becomes executable code** rather than being lost in translation
- **Mathematical rigor** applies to musical computation through functional composition

The fact that slur rendering, MIDI generation, attachment endpoint resolution, and harmonic analysis all reduce to temporal stream operations with different predicates demonstrates that musical time is the **natural computational structure** of the musical domain.

This represents **architecture as compression** - reducing the complexity of an entire problem domain to a small set of composable primitives. The timewalker demonstrates that Ooloi has discovered **musical time's computational essence**, making musical software development fundamentally more powerful and elegant.

## Performance Validation

Comprehensive benchmarks (October 2025) on a 1000-measure orchestral piece (29 instruments, ~520,000 pitches) validate the push-based transducer architecture:

**Zero-Intermediate-Allocation Proof**:
- Materialisation overhead <5% for small scopes (streaming vs collected performance nearly identical)
- Only cost is final vector allocation, not lazy sequence overhead
- Architecture delivers on zero-intermediate-allocation promise

**Streaming Characteristics (2017 MacBook Pro baseline)**:
- Full traversal: 582ms (~1M pitches/second)
- Cache refresh: 1-5ms for typical windows (10-50 measures)
- Constant memory for exports (<10 MB regardless of piece size)
- Streaming export: 1.25 seconds for 520K pitches

**M3 MacBook Air Performance (2-3× improvement)**:
- Full traversal: 316ms (~1.6M pitches/second)
- Cache refresh: 360μs (typical window)
- Typical slur search: <50 microseconds

**Scope Limiting Validation**:
- Performance scales proportionally with scope
- Boundary-VPD effectively limits traversal work
- Small scopes complete sub-millisecond to few milliseconds

**Endpoint Search Performance**:
- Typical slur searches (2-10 notes): sub-100 microseconds
  - 2 notes: ~6 µs
  - 5 notes: ~15 µs
  - 10 notes: ~29 µs
- Searches complete so quickly they're essentially unmeasurable as distinct operations
- Validates that attachment endpoint resolution has negligible performance impact

**Memory Discipline**:
- Streaming operations use constant memory
- Materialisation only allocates when random access needed
- Full materialisation: 244 MB for 520K pitches (~437 bytes per `[item vpd position]` tuple)

The benchmarks confirm that the push-based transducer architecture delivers genuine zero-intermediate-allocation, with streaming and materialised performance differing only by the final vector allocation cost.
