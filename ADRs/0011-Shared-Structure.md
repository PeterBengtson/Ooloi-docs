## Context

Ooloi's representation of a musical structure â€“ a Piece - is a pure tree. However, certain elements require references to other parts of the score, such as Slurs, Ties, Glissandos, and Dynamic Hairpins that span across the musical piece tree structure. These connecting elements sometimes require searching forward to collect intermediate elements for further processing.

Key considerations:
1. **Performance**: The solution must be efficient for musical scores of varying sizes.
2. **Temporal Coordination**: Musical processing requires proper temporal ordering - "measure N across all voices before measure N+1".
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize memory allocation through transducers and lazy evaluation, especially for large orchestral scores.
4. **Flexibility**: Must accommodate different types of connecting elements with varying rules.
5. **Maintainability**: The solution should be clear and extensible for future modifications.
6. **Simplicity**: Core code contributors should be shielded from the complexities of the underlying mechanism.
7. **Composability**: Processing operations should compose efficiently without intermediate collections.

Additional context:
- Connecting elements can vary greatly in length and complexity, from simple [ties and short slurs](#image-1) to [longer slurs inside measures](#image-2).
- In complex musical pieces, slurs can span [across multiple staves and voices](#image-3).
- Dynamic hairpins and ties can [span across multiple measures](#image-5), requiring efficient handling of measure boundaries.
- Extreme cases exist where slurs can span [entire systems or pages](#image-4), as seen in Sorabji's "Opus Clavicembalisticum IX".
- Ties always connect to the next identical pitch, making them a special case for optimization.
- Formatting slurs and dynamic hairpins requires special consideration: When these elements are encountered, all relevant musical elements under them must be collected to calculate the required presentation data.
- The timewalker system provides temporal coordination guarantees essential for musical processing.

## Decision

We will implement an efficient approach for processing and rendering musical elements in Ooloi using the **timewalker system**, which provides:

1. **Pure tree structure** for representing the musical piece.
2. **Integer ID references** for cross-tree element relationships.
3. **Temporal coordination** through the timewalker system that guarantees proper musical time ordering.
4. **Transducer-based processing** for efficient, composable operations without intermediate collections.
5. **Boundary-scoped traversal** using VPDs to limit processing to relevant sections.
6. **Specialized algorithms** that leverage timewalking for specific musical elements (slurs, ties, hairpins, etc.).

## Detailed Design

### 1. Pure Tree Structure

The Ooloi Piece is organized as a pure tree:

- Pieces contain Musicians and Layouts
- Musicians have Instruments
- Instruments have Staves
- Staves have Voices
- Voices have Measures
- Measures contain musical items (Rests, Pitches, Chords, Tuplets, Tremolandos, etc.)

### 2. Integer ID References

Elements that need to reference other parts of the score (e.g., slurs, ties) use integer IDs:

- Each Instrument maintains its own ID counter.
- IDs are generated sequentially for each new reference needed within an Instrument.
- Elements that can be referenced (e.g., Pitches, Chords) implement the TakesAttachment trait and have an `endpoint-id` field.
- Elements that reference others (e.g., Slurs) store the ID of their endpoint in an `endpoint-id` field.

### 3. Timewalker-Based Traversal

The timewalker system provides the foundation for all shared structure processing:

```clojure
;; Core traversal with temporal coordination
(timewalk piece {:boundary-vpd boundary-vpd 
                 :start-measure start-measure
                 :end-measure end-measure})

;; Returns tuples of [item vpd position] with proper temporal ordering
```

Key features:
- **Temporal Coordination**: Processes "measure N across all voices before measure N+1"
- **Boundary Scoping**: Uses VPDs to limit traversal to relevant sections
- **Early Termination**: Stops processing when criteria are met
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses transducers to avoid intermediate collections

### 4. General Extent Collection

The `collect-extent-items` function provides unified point collection for any spanning attachment:

```clojure
(defn collect-extent-items
  "Collect all musical items under any spanning attachment using timewalker.
   Works for any attachment satisfying extends-forward? or extends-forward-to-next?"
  [piece attachment start-vpd layout]
  (let [canonical-start-vpd (vpd/canonicalize start-vpd)
        instrument-boundary-vpd (vec (take 4 canonical-start-vpd))
        current-measure (or (get canonical-start-vpd 9) 0)
        ;; Find endpoint using existing attachment resolution
        [end-item end-vpd end-position] (endpoint-item piece attachment start-vpd)
        end-measure (if end-vpd (or (get end-vpd 9) current-measure) 
                                (+ current-measure MAX_LOOKAHEAD_MEASURES -1))]
    (if end-item
      (sequence (comp 
                 (timewalk {:boundary-vpd instrument-boundary-vpd 
                           :start-measure current-measure
                           :end-measure end-measure})
                 (filter takes-attachment?)  ; Only items that can have attachments
                 (obtain-xy layout))  ; Transform to x,y coordinates
                [piece])
      [])))
```

Key features:
- **General Purpose**: Works for slurs, hairpins, ottavas, pedal markings - any spanning attachment
- **Temporal Coordination**: Uses timewalker to ensure proper musical time ordering
- **Layout Awareness**: Uses `(obtain-xy layout)` transducer to get coordinates from specific layout
- **Boundary Scoping**: Limits search to relevant instrument for performance

### 5. Layout Coordinate Transformation

The `obtain-xy` transducer transforms timewalker results to layout-specific coordinates:

```clojure
(defn obtain-xy 
  "Composable transducer that transforms timewalker results to x,y coordinates.
   Takes a layout and returns a transducer for use in timewalker pipelines."
  [layout]
  (map (fn [result]
         (let [item (item result)
               vpd (vpd result)
               position (position result)]
           {:x (calculate-x-coordinate item vpd layout)
            :y (calculate-y-coordinate item vpd layout)
            :item item
            :vpd vpd
            :position position}))))
```

Design principles:
- **Composable transducer**: Integrates seamlessly with timewalker pipelines
- **Layout-specific**: Each layout may have different x,y positions due to transposition, spacing, etc.
- **Complete information**: Preserves original timewalker result data alongside coordinates

### 6. Specialized Processing Using Timewalker

Specialized processing functions leverage the timewalker for specific musical elements:

```clojure
;; Endpoint resolution using timewalker with early termination
(defn find-attachment-endpoint [piece attachment-id boundary-vpd]
  "Find attachment endpoint using efficient timewalker traversal."
  (first
    (sequence (comp (timewalk {:boundary-vpd boundary-vpd})
                    (filter takes-attachment?)
                    (filter #(= attachment-id (get-endpoint-id (item %))))
                    (take 1))  ; Early termination
              [piece])))

;; General attachment processing pattern
(defn process-spanning-attachment [piece attachment start-vpd layout]
  "Generic pattern for processing any spanning attachment."
  (let [points (collect-extent-items piece attachment start-vpd layout)]
    ;; Process points according to attachment-specific algorithm
    ;; (slur curves, hairpin crescendos, glissando lines, etc.)
    ))
```

This approach provides:
- **Code reuse**: `collect-extent-items` works for all spanning attachments  
- **Efficiency**: Timewalker's early termination and boundary scoping
- **Temporal correctness**: Proper musical time ordering maintained
- **Specialized implementations**: See ADR-0013 for detailed slur formatting example

## Rationale

1. **Pure tree structure** simplifies many operations and allows for straightforward serialization and deserialization.
2. **Integer ID references** provide a clean way to represent relationships between elements across the tree without creating cycles.
3. **Timewalker system** provides temporal coordination essential for musical applications, ensuring "measure N before measure N+1" ordering.
4. **Transducer architecture** enables efficient, composable operations without intermediate collections, crucial for handling large orchestral scores.
5. **Boundary-scoped processing** using VPDs allows efficient limitation of traversal to relevant sections only.
6. **Layout abstraction** through `obtain-xy` transducer allows the same algorithms to work with different layout contexts.
7. **Unified collection pattern** through `collect-extent-items` enables code reuse across all spanning attachment types.
8. **Early termination support** prevents unnecessary processing in large scores through efficient `take` operations.

## Example Applications

The shared structure system handles a wide range of spanning musical elements:

- **Simple connections**: Ties between identical pitches, basic slurs over a few notes
- **Cross-measure elements**: Dynamic hairpins (crescendo/diminuendo) spanning multiple measures
- **Multi-staff elements**: Slurs connecting notes across different staves in piano music
- **System-wide elements**: Long slurs spanning entire musical systems in complex works
- **Other spanning attachments**: Glissandos, ottava markings, pedal markings, and other elements that extend across musical time

For a detailed implementation example, see [ADR-0013: Slur Formatting](0013-Slur-Formatting.md), which demonstrates how the shared structure system is applied to slur rendering using convex hull algorithms and dual BÃ©zier curves.
